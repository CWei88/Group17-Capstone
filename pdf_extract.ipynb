The same applies to the topic of sustainability. While others talk, we set actions into motion. Bold visions and distant targets are fineandgood, , whatreallymattersisthatwemakeaneffectivecontribu-tion to environmental and climate protection here and now. Because the only way to realise grand visions like that of a climate-neutral Europe in 2050 is by implementing con-crete measures today. Sustainability is not just a trend for us. It is a call to action. For us its about thinking and acting beyond today for tomorrow. This can be seen in our Sustainable Value Report targets that we set in 2012 for 2020orareinthefinalstretch towards achieving them. Our road to sustainable mobility: we plan to meet Europes CO2 requirements for 2020 and 2021. A major focus of our sustainability strategy is lowering CO2 emissions. In recent years, we have steadily reduced the CO2emissions of ourvehicle fleet andachieveda decrease of around 40 per cent between 1990 and 2019. In 2020, we will once again lower our carbon emissions in Europesignificantly,withadecreaseofaround20 per cent from the previous year. This means we plan to meet Europes ambitious CO2 targets for 2020 and 2021. One Oliver Zipse Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG',\n",
       " 5: '5 Introduction Preface An overview of the BMW Group Key sustainability indicators Transformation of the BMW Group 1 Fundamentals 2 Products and services 3 Production and value creation 4 Employees and society Appendix factor in achieving this is to inspire more customers to drive electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. This accounts for about two-thirds of the reduction. The remaining third willcomefromfurtherefficiencymeasuresforourconven-tional engines. We have a clear e-mobility roadmap. A quarter of the vehicles we sell in Europe should be elec-trifiedby2021; a third in 2025 and half in 2030. In 2019, we delivered over 146,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids to customers worldwide. That means we nowhaveatotalofmorethanhalfamillionelectrifiedvehi-cles on the roads across the globe. However, it is also clear that people all over the world will continue to buy vehicles with a conventional engine. For many people worldwide, it is still the best choice for their individual mobility needs. It is precisely because we takeclimateprotectionsoseriouslythatwehavetakenEffi-cient Dynamics to the next level by making our conven-tional engines systematically even more accomplished. Effective climate protection cannot be achieved with bans. Wewillcontinuetoofferourcustomersawiderangeof drivetechnologies,wheretheycanchoosebetweendiffer-ent drive trains in all relevant vehicle segments accord-ing to their mobility needs and desires. This gives our cus-tomersthePowerofChoice. From production to recycling: we take a holistic approach. Our understanding of sustainability is not limited to on the entire value chain. In our supply chain, for example, we have created a high level of transparency. Moreover, our suppliers must commit to the BMW Groups high sustain-ability standards. We support them, for instance, by sour-cing cobalt and lithium directly and making it available to our partners, starting 2020. Since 2017, all BMW Group locations in Europe have obtained their externally pur-chased electricity exclusively from renewable sources; from 2020, all BMW Group locations worldwide will do the same. This shows our full commitment to sustainability across the company. The BMW Group is driving active environmental protection. Wewerethefirstautomobilemanufacturertoappointan environmentalofficerinourorganisationbackin1973. Since 2001, we have been committed to the UN Global Compact and implement its ten principles at all our loca-tions worldwide. The fully-electric BMW i3, with its 360-degree approach, has been a pioneer in sustainable mobility since 2013. Now, we are going even further: we have set ourselves ambitious targets to successfully tackle a variety of new challenges. For this very reason, we have decided to fully incorporate our sustainability strategy into the BMW cor-porate strategy. This will fully ensure that the companys thinking and actions are aligned in a sustainable manner. For me, this is how environmental and climate protection can achieve a real impact across the company and within society.

The retrospective adjustment enables better comparability. Additional information can be found in the Annex under Additional information on delivery figures. 1 The figures for the previous financial year were adjusted due to a change in accounting methods when IFRS 16 was introduced, see [6] in the Group appendix of the Annual Report 2019. In addition, the figures for the previous year were adjusted due to the change in how selected topics that are of subordinate importance overall are posted. 2 Since 09 / 2018 all vehicles in the EU must be licensed according to the new WLTP test cycle. However, the calculation of CO2 emissions from fleet vehicles will only be switched to WLTP in 2021 by the European Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate WLTP fleet emissions back to NEDC values up to and including 2020 for reporting purposes. The changed WLTP test constraints lead to higher NEDC emissions (NEDC correlated) due to the reversed calculations. In order to ensure comparability, the CO2 fleet emissions for 2017 (122 g / km NEDC) were converted to a correlated NEDC value of 128 g / km under WLTP test constraints and published originally with the 2 / 2018 quarterly report. 3 Adjusted value in line with planned change to WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure) 4 Calculated based on volumes of green energy purchased as well as the conservative calculation of country-specific energy shares from renewables purchased from third parties.

Sustainability is part and parcel of the BMW Groups busi-ness model. We have set clear goals for sustainable individ-ual mobility, resource-efficient value creation, our employees development and our engagement in society. In pursuing these goals, our aim is to ensure a viable future for our busi-ness while improving the customer experience. Assuming responsibility is an integral part of the BMW Groups core business vision. We are convinced that the lasting success of any enterprise in todays economy comes down to acting responsibly and ensuring social acceptance. Global challenges such as climate change and urbanisation inspire and motivate us to develop innova-tive products and services. We achieve a competitive advantage by providing for-ward-looking solutions. Sustainability is an integral part of our corporate Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT. Our strategy provides the practical framework for the BMW Groups long-term development and sets out the stra-tegic approaches we will be taking through to 2025. We are helping to take individual mobility into a new dimen-sion, with electric, connected and autonomous vehicles. In this process, our work focuses on electromobility, autono-mous driving and digitalisation and is geared to our cus-tomers needs. As drivers of innovation, we are commit-ted to taking the leading role within the automotive indus-try in these areas. Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT G1.01 Mission Competitive edge Strategic approach Culture To add value to our business, our environment and the soci-ety we live in, the BMW Group integrates sustainability across the entire value chain and into all our basic pro-cesses. This covers everything from the sustainability requirements for the procurement process and the design of our products through to the development of new lines of business. GRI 102-11 see graphic 1.02 Pursuing long-term sustainability goals In 2012, the BMW Group set itself ten strategic sustainabil-ity goals running through to 2020, which we have since con-sistently pursued.

Electromobility The BMW Group will be a leader in taking a holistic approach to premium electromobility. Mobility patterns By 2020, the BMW Group will have permanently changed mobility patterns in selected metro-politan areas by rolling out integrated mobility services. PRODUCTION AND VALUE CREATION Consumption of resources By 2020, the BMW Group will have reduced its resource consumption (energy, water, waste for disposal, solvents) per vehicle produced by 45 % (base year: 2006). Renewable energy The BMW Group will be the leader in the use of renewable energy in production and value creation. Sustainable, resource-efficient supply chain By 2020, the BMW Group will have significantly increased supply chain transparency and resource efficiency. EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY Health and performance To preserve the health and the performance of its employees in the long term, the BMW Group will promote a culture of personal responsibility and ensure an appropriately designed work environment Long-term employee development The BMW Group will ensure long-term employee development by seeking out the right employees, making the most of their talents, developing potential and ensuring employability. Diversity Through its diverse workforce, the BMW Group will increase its competitiveness and enhance its innovative strength. Corporate citizenship The BMW Group will be a leader in intercultural understanding. As of the end of 2019, the BMW Group has reduced CO2 emissions to a level 42.4 % lower than in 1995. We have specific plans to help us achieve the 2020 goal in full. chapter 2.1 Thanks to our broad range of electrified vehicle products, the BMW Group is a market leader in new vehicle registrations in this field in Germany (based on total market share). In Europe: sec-ond (total market share); globally: third (premium segment). We therefore expect to achieve this goal by 2020 and have already announced further ambitious goals in addition. chapter 2.2 In recent years, we have begun to offer a number of urban mobility services (including a joint venture with Daimler AG), making a positive impact on mobility patterns in selected cities. As a result, we expect to meet this goal in 2020. chapter 2.3 This goal has already been achieved in part. In terms of waste and solvents, we have already far surpassed the set goals as of 2019 (waste: 78.4 %, solvents: 66.1 %). As far as energy (2019: 40.4 %) and water (2019: 28.8 %) are concerned, we are currently significantly ahead of our direct competitors based on their publicly accessible sustainability reports, although we are still yet to reach the 45 % target. chapter 3.1 By 2018, our European plants were already powered by 100 % renewable energy or offsets were made to this effect. In 2020, we are aiming to reach this figure for all our plants worldwide. chapter 3.2 In terms of transparency, we consider the target achieved, especially when it comes to critical raw materials (such as cobalt). However, we still see a need for resource efficiency to be improved in 2020. chapter 3.3 The BMW Group has already achieved its self-imposed goal thanks to various measures in the area of occupational safety. We expect this to continue in 2020. chapter 4.1 From the BMW Groups perspective, this goal has already been achieved as of 2019. Evidence for this includes external studies on employer attractiveness and our in-house employee survey. In 2020, we expect to continue meeting this goal. chapter 4.2 The global reach of the BMW Group is also reflected in the diversity of our workforce. The pro-portion of women in management positions (17.5 %) is above our self-imposed target range. chapter 4.3 Since 2011, we have been able to reach more than 3.6 million people with our intercultural understanding projects. chapter 4.4 Combined separate non-financial report',\n",

The latest update was undertaken in 2018. For a list of the material issues, please see the GRI-Index. For detailed information about the materiality process, please see last years Sustainable Value Report 2018 (pages 1314). GRI 102-46, 102-47 Looking ahead 2020 will be a transformational year for the BMW Group. As the year comes to a close, it will mark the end of the intended implementation phase for our current set of sus-tainability goals. In addition, we are already hard at work incorporating new sustainability goals into our business strategy. Some of the questions at the heart of this planning process are: How can we incorporate the goals set in the Paris ClimateAgreementmoresubstantiallyandeffectively into our business activities? Building on the insights gained from recycling, how can we ensure an increasing number of closed-loop material cycles as part of a circular economy? How can we deal with new and changing requirements, expectations and risks pertaining to the companys supply chain? How can we further improve our understanding of ourcustomersindividualmobilitychoicesandoffer appropriate solutions? We are taking new developments and standards from the regulatory code and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into account, as well as the expectations of our stakeholders in civil society and the capital market. Working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals In autumn 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations announced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are at the core of the 2030 Agenda, a global action plan aiming to ensure that economic progress is environ-mentally friendly and socially equitable. We are convinced that companies, governments and other organisations can each make a positive contribution towards achieving the objectives set out in the SDGs. We also believe that it is our duty to uphold this social contract. We too are committed to supporting the SDGs as part of our sustainable business strategy, focusing on our value chain. For us, this also means factoring in the 2C target set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. In 2018, we provided a detailed explanation of which UN Sustainable Development Goals we were working on the most to help achieve our existing list of ten sustainability goals.

To ensure compliance with these principles across all divisions of the company, we have defined clear guide-lines and responsibilities. These are supported by oversight and incentive systems. Involving the Board in sustainability management The Board of Management governs the BMW Group under its own responsibility, acting in the interests of the com-pany and with the aim of achieving sustainable growth in value. It determines the strategic orientation of the enter-prise and ensures its implementation. The Board of Man-agement is also responsible for ensuring compliance with all provisions of the law and internal regulations as well as for adequate risk management and controlling. The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Management in conducting its duties (dual management system). GRI 102-18 Following the restructuring of the BMW Groups Corpor-ate Strategy division, there is now joint responsibility for sustainability and mobility. This involves taking the changes in mobility systems and their impacts on the BMW Group into account, analysing these changes and impacts in view of requirements for doing business sustainably, evaluating these changes and impacts, and translating them into stra-tegic assumptions for the company. At the same time, the operational duties related to environmental management system oversight at our various locations were transferred to the relevant central department. The Sustainability and Mobility department is under the direct organisational supervision of the Chairman of the Board of Management within the Corporate Strategy divi-sion. This unit is responsible for global sustainability man-agement. Its tasks include: Identifying challenges and opportunities for sustain able operations Developing and monitoring sustainability goals Further developing, specifying and integrating sustainability into the individual divisions, taking the entire value chain into account Ensuring the cooperation of all departments in the company involved in sustainability Helping to deliver a sustainable mobility system, especially in urban areas Managing sustainability on a long-term basis The Board of Management works to ensure that the Groups Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT is aligned with sustain-ability in the long term. The special-purpose Sustainabil-ity Board was fully involved in regular Board of Manage-ment meetings in 2019, allowing sustainability issues to be even more consistently integrated into the companys deci-sion-making processes. Since then, sustainability issues have been treated like every other topic and discussed as needed at fortnightly Board of Management meetings. All specificdecisionsreferredtotheBoardofManagementare subject to a mandatory sustainability evaluation. The deci-sions to be made by the Board of Management are prepared by the Strategy and Structure Working Group. This group consists of the top management of the company divisions and also addresses sustainability issues. The BMW Groups governance principles are set down in the Corporate Gov-ernance Code.

First, this means that every major issue and project must be measurable in terms of sustainability as a corpor-ate objective. This way, we ensure that, in addition to eco-nomic factors, environmental and social aspects are also accounted for in the decision-making process. It also means that sustainability as a corporate objective is broken down to the level of business areas and divisions. As a result, the personal targets set for managers include sustainability aspectsandcriteriawhichhaveaneffectontheirperform-ance-based remuneration. GRI 102-19, GRI 102-28 Rewarding sustainable business success The Supervisory Board decides on the level of compensation received by members of the Board of Management, orient-ing its decisions on the sustainable development of the BMW Group. Bonuses are also based in part on personal performance, evaluated primarily according to qualitative criteria. These criteria include environmental innovation ( ),leadershipaccomplish-ments and the ability to lead change processes. Additional criteria are: enhancing the companys attractiveness as an employer, progress in the implementation of the diversity concept, which is presented to the Supervisory Board in a report, as well as activities that advance corporate citizen-ship in the BMW Group.

Our production and ourproductshaveanimpactontheenvironmentandaffect the interests of a variety of stakeholders. At the same time, the viewpoints, decisions and actions of our stakeholders have a decisive impact on the success of our enterprise. We therefore engage in ongoing dialogue regarding sustain-ability topics with our stakeholders in relevant markets and at all our locations. Our long-term involvement in the UNs climate change conferences (COPs) is an important platform for our inter-action with stakeholders, with the most recent of these events held in Madrid in 2019. In dialogue with our stakeholders, we want to build trust, understand positions, identify trends as well as build on and consolidate partnerships. In doing so, we also deliberately address critical issues and debates. Thishelpsustoanalysemoreeffectivelywhatnextsteps are required or are expected of us in the individual areas of action in sustainability management. At the same time, by engaging in dialogue, we can show in a transparent manner what scope we see for action when confronted with current challenges and the prerequisites and frame-work conditions that are important to us. With every type of stakeholder dialogue we engage in, feedback from our stakeholders is always factored into the companys stra-tegic considerations. These interactions are based on our Stakeholder Engagement ,determinesthe criteria for identifying and prioritising our stakeholders and provides a template for a range of suitable dialogue formats and communication channels. GRI 102-42 Continuousandsystematicidentificationandprioritisation of relevant stakeholders and their topics of interest is a cor-nerstone of stakeholder dialogue. To this end, we regularly carryoutstakeholdermappingonstrategicallyimport-ant topics at all relevant locations. We cover issues brought up by our stakeholders, as well as topics about which we actively seek out our stakeholders views. Some of the major topics our stakeholders raised with us in 2019 were: Combating climate change (in particular, CO2 emissions) Human rights in the supply chain (in particular, raw materials for electromobility applications) Sustainablefinance Some of the major topics on which we solicited our stake-holders views were: Key aspects of corporate responsibility (responsibility for products and production, responsibility for resources, responsibility for the supply chain, respon-sibility for the mobility of the future, responsibility for employees, social responsibility) GRI 102-44 Combined separate non-financial report',\n",

The challenges and needs determined on this basisarethenchannelledintospecificresearchprojects. Decarbonisation and digitalisation are currently in the spotlight of social and political debate. There is an increas-ing degree of overlap between the two phenomena, as con-nectedtechnologiesoffersignificantopportunitiestomake transportmoreefficient(and,inturn,moreenvironmen-tally friendly with lower emissions levels). These possibil-ities range from better route planning to user-friendly inte-gration of public and private mobility options.

The EUs legislative process on the taxonomy is expected to be com-pletedinthefirstquarterof2020. Sustainability is also a factor that the BMW Group takes into consideration when it comes to pension fund invest-ments. The company regularly examines compliance with sustainability standards during the process of allocation of asset management mandates. The BMW pension fund is already selectively invested in various liquid asset classes with a targeted ESG focus. In the illiquid asset class, part of the fund has already been invested into targeted SDG ,climaterisksassociated with the fund are measured at regular intervals with the aim of long-term risk reduction. Involvement in associations The BMW Group is a member of various associations in a number of countries. Our membership is voluntary in the majority of cases, although there are some situations in which these memberships are necessary to comply with legal requirements. In all of these cases, the BMW Groups role is to commu-nicate its position to obtain information about the stances the associations adopt.

The active and passive safety systems used in our vehicles ensure greater safety on the road, and we avoid the use of substances hazardous to human health in our production processes. We also inform our customers about all the safety aspects of our products while enabling them to rec-ognise and overcome dangerous situations by taking driver safety training. The safety of our vehicles is a central component of our product responsibility as a premium manufacturing com-pany. We take a holistic approach to safety and security that includes technical solutions, training, information and data protection, based on our desire to meet our customers high expectations for safety, comfort and convenience. Using safety systems to minimise risks The active and passive safety measures used in our ve hicles, which meet the highest quality standards, allow us to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries faced by our cus-tomers and other road users. These safety measures include perfect chassis tuning, strengthenedpassengercompartments,effectivebrakes, airbags and driver assistance systems. Reducing hazardous materials protecting health and the environment Starting at the design stage for our vehicles, we consciously avoid the use of problematic materials and take active steps to minimise emissions in the passenger compartment. In this way, we seek to ensure that legal requirements for product safety, protection of human health and the envir-onment are taken into account around the world for each phase of the vehicle life cycle (from development to use to recycling to disposal). In addition, all vehicles that belong to the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands are equipped with passenger compart-mentairfiltersasstandardcomponents,whichfilterout pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from the outside air. Comprehensive information on safety aspects We give our customers access to comprehensive informa-tion on how to correctly use our products and services.

We therefore consistently strive to reduce emissions of CO2 and pollutants in the development of our vehicle fleet so that we can continue to meet the statutory limits world-wide. Incentives for sustainable mobility also play an important role in the purchase decision of customers. Besides buyers premiums and reduced taxes, examples of these include exceptions to potential traffic restrictions as well as prefer-ential treatment in lane usage and parking concessions for electrified vehicles. We respond to the growing envir-onmental awareness of many customers by expanding our portfolio of low-emission, efficient vehicles. They can select the right drivetrain technology for their mobility needs thanks to our Power of Choice concept. By taking measures to reduce the emissions of CO2 and pollutants, we act in line with the UN Sustainable Devel-opment Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good health and well-being), 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action). Lowering emissions with efficiency technologies and solutions for pollutant reduction In our conventional drive vehicles, we currently achieve themosteffectiveimpactonloweringCO2 and pollutant emissionsthroughourefficiencytechnologiesandthrough specificsolutionsforpollutantreduction. The BMWGroupiscontinuingtoconcentrateitseffortson reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. For ex ample, the BMW 520d* and 520d Touring* models were launched with 48-volt technology in 2019. These models, powered by a 140kW/190 Hp four-cylinder diesel engine, reduce fuel consumption by up to 0.3 litres per 100 km. The mild hybrid technology with a 48-volt electrical system will be gradually rolled out for our diesel and petrol engines in all series. This will help to further reduce the CO2 emissions of our conventional drive vehicles. Reducing local emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) in par-ticular is key to improving urban air quality. For this rea-son, all diesel models of the BMWGrouphavebeenfitted withahighlyeffectivecombinationofaNOx storage cata-lytic converter (NSC) and a SCR system (SCR, Selective Catalytic Reduction) with urea injection (AdBlue) since mid-2018 (except for MINI 3-door cars, 5-door cars and convertible models).

This harmonisation results in dependable and predictable guidelines. We intend to continue to meet the EU emissions targets in 2020 and 2021, and beyond. In view of the global CO2fleet targets, the BMW Group pursues the clear objectives of meeting limits and, where we consider it to be appropriate, surpassing these. For example, together with other vehicle manufacturers we reached an agreement with the US state of California which aims to reduce emissions by 3.7 % per year in the period between 2022 to 2026. We are planning tovoluntarilyalignourfleetinall50 states and apply a uni-form standard in accordance with this guideline.

Reducing particulate matter and NOx is an important starting point. Besides promoting alternative emission-free drivetrains and an improved range of mobility services, somecitiesarealsointroducingtrafficrestrictionsforindi-vidual road sections or entire zones. For example, older petrol models (exhaust emission stand-ards Euro 0 and 1) and diesel engine cars (Euro 0 to 2) are permanently prohibited from entering the green zone in (Euro0 to 3) are required topayanadditionalfeeintheinnercityofLondon/UK. In Germany, older vehicles (Euro 0 to 3, depending on the classificationofthegreenzone)havebeenbannedsince 2007 from entering certain city regions following the intro-duction of environmental badges. A total of 58 such green zones, of which 57 carry the maximum restriction of at least Euro 4 or Euro 3withparticlefilter,nowexistinGer-man cities. However, despite these measures, the public debate still centred around urban air quality in the year under review, particularly in Germany. Independent of the establishment of these green zones, which predominantly target particu-late matter, the BMW Group introduced a diesel particle filterasawaytoeffectivelyreduceparticulatematterseveral years before the legal requirement came into force. The cur-rent diesel models of the BMW Group are also proving to bemoreefficientatreducingtheamountofNOx they emit. They are thus more environmentally friendly compared to ,muchstricter trafficrestrictionsfordieselmodels(emissionslevelEuro 4 and, in some cases, 5) have already been decided upon and introduced. In this regard, the German government assists the federal statesandaffectedcitiesincomplyingwiththeapplicable air quality limits as quickly as possible and in exploiting the full potential of all measures seeking to reduce nitro-gen without restricting mobility.

From the perspective of the BMW Group, the modern diesel engine can also continue to make an important contribution towards improving air quality and achieving national and interna-tional CO2 reduction targets in the short and medium term. A diesel engine emits up to 15 % less CO2 than a petrol engine and there is still no comprehensive infrastructure for alternative drivetrain technologies.

This is reflected again and again in our dialogue with stakeholders. Our electrified vehicles1 combine the advan-tages of sustainable mobility and technological conveni-ence. Fully electric battery models (BEV) have zero local emissions and can significantly reduce traffic noise in cit-ies. Compared to the conventional drivetrain technology, they have a more efficient electric engine and quicker acceleration. This means that we can offer our customers an entirely new driving experience. We intend to set standards in electromobility and contrib-ute towards fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement. To underline our claim to leadership, we are aiming to contin-ually increase the sales of our electrified vehicles by 2025. By 2021, we are planning to more than double sales com-pared to 2019. By taking measures to further enhance elec-tromobility, we are contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (Affordable and clean energy), 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 12 (Responsible con-sumption and production) and 13 (Climate action). see chapter 1.1 1 The term electrified vehicles has varying definitions in the automotive industry. The BMW Group defines these as fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that can be charged and driven purely electrically. Achieving sustainability over the entire life cycle From the very beginning of the BMW i project, we have beenoneofthefirstmanufacturerstopursuethegoalof consistently reducing the emissions of CO2 and other pol-lutants over the entire life cycle. We are continuously work-ing on this. As most of the CO2 emissions emitted by BEVs arise from the manufacture of the essential components, we rely on renewable resourcesandhighlyresource-effi-cient and environmentally friendly production processes. Another decisive factor is the use of renewable energy sources in the BMW value chain: from the manufacture of energy-intensive materials such as CFRP(carbonfibrerein-forced polymer), to vehicle production and the BMW Green Energypackageweofferourcustomerswhentheypur-chase their vehicle. Other approaches include the recycling and reuse of bat-teries, for example in stationary storage units for improved use of renewables. Improving range and expanding our vehicle portfolio A key challenge for the success of electromobility is improv-ing the range of our vehicles. For example, we increased the range of the BMW X5 PHEV2 from 31 km (2015, accord-ing to the NEDC cycle) to 80 km3, the BMW 530e PHEV2 from 45 km (2017, according to the NEDC cycle) to 60 km3, the BMW 330e PHEV2 from 40 km (2016, according to the NEDC cycle) to 60 km3 and the BMW i3 BEV2 from 300 km (2016, according to the NEDC cycle) to 359 km4. We have doubled the range of the BMW i3 compared to 2013. We are working towards our goal of continually increasing range by taking a number of measures. 2 See consumption and CO2 data, p. 138 3 Range already calculated on the basis of the new WLTP test cycle and retroactively calcu-lated as an NEDC value for the purposes of comparability.

Furthermore, we are always expanding our network of dealerships and package of measures is rounded out with focused market-ingcampaignsandfinancingoffersforelectrifiedcars. Facilitating rapid charging and improving access to charging stations In collaboration with other carmakers, charging station operators, energy suppliers and grid operators, we are work-ing towards simplifying access to charging stations and the charging procedure. We are working to achieve this by deployingourspecialistexpertiseandwithfinancialsupport. In joint venture with IONITY, we plan to establish a high-performing rapid charging network with 400 rapid charging stations along major transport axes by 2020 at the European level. This will facilitate charging that is up to seven times faster than normal 50 kw stations. This means that appropriately equipped vehicles can be charged in ten to 15 minutes. We want to make electromobility even more convenient for both private customers and companies who operate whole fleetsandcontinuetoexpandourBMW 360 ELECTRIC product and service portfolio for state-of-the-art charging solutions. To promote electromobility among our own employees, we are increasing the number of charging points at BMW Group locations. We plan to install more than 4,100chargingpointsforelectrifiedcarsatourGerman locations by 2021. Charging options at work are becoming increasingly important for our employees as more and more ofthemaredrivingelectrifiedvehiclesoftheBMW Group. We plan to make about half of the charging points available to the public. Improving framework conditions in dialogue with policy-makers From the perspective of the BMW Group, in many coun-tries there is still a need for governments to catch up in terms of political support for electromobility. We seek out dialogue with policy-makers regarding the consistency of policy measures on the supply and demand sides. We are involved, for example, in the Nationale Plattform Elektromobilitt (National Platform for Electromobility NPE) in Germany and the Agora Verkehrswende (Agora traffictransition).Internationally,theBMW Group is a member of the international advisory committee of China EV 100, as well as VELOZ,anon-profitorganisationinthe US state of California which promotes electromobility. Due diligence processes: Anchoring carbon footprints in product development A holistic, life cycle-oriented regard for environmental impact is an integral part of the target systems and organ-isational processes in our vehicle development. We manage the implementation of targets and evaluation of progress in the development process by applying the Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with ISO standard /44. These carbon footprints allow us to determine at the development stage the environmental impact the vehicle will have during its life cycle. This also allows for comparison with predecessor models. As an example, the BMW 745Le, Environmental Report shows that, assuming standard consumption levels, the potential greenhouse gas values of a plug-in hybrid ve hicle are around 33 % lower over the entire life cycle than in a conventional reference vehicle, taking account of the EU-25 electricity mix.

Results and performance indicators: Electrified vehicles improved holistically and sales increased In total, we had sold around 504,000 vehicles with electric and plug-in hybrid drives by the end of 2019, which means that we surpassed our goal of selling 500,000 vehicles. In 2019, the BMW Group delivered 146.1601electrifiedvehicles (2018: 142.385), making it once again a leading provider in the electromobility sector. Since 2018, new and existing customers have been able to opt for a BMW i3* model and the third generation of high-voltage batteries with a capacity of 42 kilowatt hours. As an urban brand, MINIalsooffers Cooper SE*, available for order since its launch in 2019, has a range of 242 to 270 km according to the NEDC. Competence centre for battery cells opened In 2019, we began pooling our many years of experience and comprehensive expertise in battery cells in a new advances in battery cell technology and fully penetrate pro-duction processes. Taking the current technology of the BMW i3* as a starting point, we intend to double the energy density of our battery cells by 2030 and thus increase the range for our customers. The new competence centre rep-resents the entire value chain of the battery cell technol-ogy from research and development, through to the com-position and design of the battery cells. In accordance with our life cycle approach, sustainability is taken into consid-eration throughout all stages, from the procurement of raw materials to recycling. Charging infrastructure further expanded From 2015 to the end of 2019, the BMW Group was involved in over 50 projects for improving the charging infrastruc-ture and initiated the installation of around 15,000 charg-ing points. High-performing and increasingly widespread 50 kw direct current charging points ensure a BMW i3* can be charged to 80 % in around 45 minutes. 202 of the 400 IONITY rapid charging stations have been installed to date.

In future, employ-ees of the BMW Group will be able to conveniently and inexpensively charge their electric vehicles with green electricity at more than 4,100 new charging points in the parking areas of BMW Group production plants, development centres and office locations. About half of the charging points will be available to the public. The project is expected to be completed by 2021. By introducing discounts for tickets for public transport (Job Ticket), company buses and the BMW LeaseRad bike scheme, we provide in-centives for employees to use other means of transport and improve traffic conditions at our locations. We are not looking to replace the car completely but rather to demonstrate other mobility alternatives. For example, some 45 % of employees commute to BMW Groups Research and Innovation Centre in Munich every day by car or motor-bike, around 40 % by public transport and about 5 % by company bus. Around 10 % travel by bike or walk. 52 Introduction 1 Fundamentals 2 Products and services 2.1 Emissions of CO2 and pollutants 2.2 Electromobility 2.3 Mobility patterns 3 Production and value creation 4 Employees and society Appendix Further key indicators The market for electromobility in Europe Withitsshareofelectrifiedvehicles,theBMW brand is currently the market leader in Germany and ranks second in Europe.

The focus is always on our brand promise of driving enjoyment. This has become a chal-lenge, especially in densely populated urban spaces, but also on the motorways around large cities. By 2030, a pro-jected 60 % of people worldwide will live in cities. The related increase in traffic volumes often goes hand in hand with a significant rise in noise and air pollution, con-sumption of space as well as increased risk of accidents. We are proactive in taking these challenges into account as we develop our networked vehicles and mobility ser-vices. Our measures are designed to contribute to UN Sus-tainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 (Industry, innova-tion and infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and com-munities) and 13 (Climate action). The technological shift towards electrification, digitalisa-tion and new mobility services is fundamentally changing the sector. The integration of cars into a multimodal, increasingly digitally networked mobility ecosystem especially in urban areas represents a great entrepre-neurial challenge. Up until 2019, the BMW Group focussed on expanding its car-sharing services in cities in Germany, Europe and the USA. In 2019, mobility services were strategically reviewed and then reoriented. This involved the merging of a broad spectrum of mobility-related services with Daimler AG under YOUR NOW (car-sharing, taxi/ride hailing, charging and parking).

Preventively protecting customer information and data The protection of information and data is an integral part of business processes at the BMW Group. Data protection adheres to the relevant laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Our information protection complies with the international security standard ISO/IEC . The personal data of our customers is only collected, processed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the consent of the person in question. We address com-plaints in a timely manner. In order to protect our digital systems from manipulations, we systematically search out weak points with a view to closing any potential gaps in good time before releasing the respective component. We continuously convert new insights into mandatory standards. There are also clear guidelines for information and data protection for cooper-ation and partner relationships. We introduced BMW CarData in Germany in 2017 and then in Europe the following year. This is a service that gives our customers the option of deciding about the utili-sation and transmission of data from vehicles to third par-ties in compliance with data protection legislation. We now want to establish this service in other core markets such as the USA. Providing services for more sustainable mobility In addition to our highly automated vehicles, we plan to provide our customers with mobility in a seamlessly net-worked, sustainable ecosystem consisting of car-sharing, ride-hailing, parking, charging and multimodality. For this purpose, we merged our mobility services with those of Daimler AG in a joint venture in 2019. The joint venture comprised the following activities and services: REACH NOW (multimodal and on-demand mobility), SHARE NOW (car-sharing), FREE NOW (ride-hailing), PARK NOW (parking) and CHARGE NOW (charging).

The role of the car in the transport sys-tem of the future, particularly in urban areas, is one of the greatest challenges for the future of the car and is addressed accordingly by the BMW Group, along with the reduction of the CO2 emissions and the sustainability of supply chains. Trends in the main markets are analysed very closely. In order to understand changes, impacts and needs of urban mobility patterns worldwide in good time, the BMW Group takes part in projects focused on dialogue, initiators and research. These include the BMW Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo) and the BMW Group Dialogues with stake-holders.

Therefore, the BMW Group has set ambitious sustainability goals for itself and, by continuously improving energy- and resource-efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions in produc-tion processes, it is making a valuable contribution towards protecting the environment and the climate. In this way, we are contributing in particular towards achiev-ing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action). Byimplementingmeasuresforincreasingresourceeffi-ciency, we are meeting our responsibilities to society and the environment. Through sustainable management we are taking into account our stakeholders expectations and in addition we are reducing our production costs in the medium term. Conserving resources by means of optimising processes and new technologies In order to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption in vehicle production, we are optimising processes and , we com-missionedournewplantinSanLuisPotos/MX,which hasbeenequippedwithhighlyefficienttechnology.

At ten other BMW Group locations, best practices weresharedatworkshopsonenergyefficiency,basedon the methods of the WPS-Lernwerkstatt (learning work-shop for a value creation-focused production system). We also rely on optimised processes and state-of-the-art technology to reduce our water consumption and waste-water. In this context, key measures are introducing water-less processes in our foundries, repeatedly using treated process wastewater as well as further optimising processes in our paint shops and wastewater treatment plants.

Coordinating environmental protection measures globally through competence centres The BMWGrouphasfiveenvironmentalcentresofcom-petence in the areas of emissions, water, waste, training byenvironmentalexpertsfromthedifferentplantsandby specialists from Corporate Environmental Protection. The managers of participating plants as well as the Corpor-ate Energy Management department of the BMW Group the competence centres and Energy Management discuss legal requirements and best-practice solutions with tech-nology experts from the production plants. In addition, they develop reference systems on which to base future planning and process improvements. Environmentalimprovementsthathavebeeneffectiveat one location are implemented at other locations wherever possible. Furthermore, we pass on our experiences to our suppliers in order to foster sustainability in our supply chain as well. Closing gaps in material cycles and reducing waste In order to minimise waste, we are developing recycling and reprocessing concepts that are customised for waste streamsinthedifferentplants,varyinglegalrequirements and existing disposal structures. This is not just important waste poses a global challenge. At our German production locations, for example, many waste incinerators are work-ing at capacity. Starting in the product development phase, we are ensur-ing economical use of resources and design products with the aim of making certain that as many material cycles as possible can be closed. In 2019, we closed the gaps in addi-tional waste metal cycles by sending waste metal from our pressing plants back to our steel suppliers. see further key indicators Due diligence processes: Controlling consumption of resources through environ-mental management In 2001, the BMW Group signed the United Nations Envi-r onment Programmes International Declaration on CleanerProductionandexpresslycommittedtokeeping the envir onmental impact and resource consumption of our production activities as low as possible. Controlling resource consumption is an integral part of environmental management at our plants. The processes are overseen by the steering committee of the BMW Groups international environmental network. Each machine, build-ing and space in each plant is allocated to an operator. This person is responsible for the processes and procedures, machines and technical systems as well as their environ-mental impacts in their allocated area. We have introduced environmental management systems at all of our existing production plants and plan to roll them out at all future locations.

The requirements for recycling-optimised development and production of our vehicles as well as selec-tionanduseofsecondarymaterialsaredefinedinasep-arate BMW Group standard. We design our supply chains andmaterialflowsaccordingly. When using potentially supply-critical raw materials such as rare earths, we carefully consider weight, function and costs. Wherever it makes technical and business sense, we replaceartificialmaterialswithrecyclatesorrenewable materials. It is important to us to use recycled materials or renew able raw materials in our vehicles. Up to 20 % of the thermo-plastic materials in our vehicles are made from recyclates. These thermoplastic materials account for an average of 12 % of vehicle weight. We use up to 50 % secondary alu-minium in high-strength cast aluminium parts. GRI 301-2 In our BMW i3* in particular, we use a large proportion of recycled plastics and natural fabrics.

The initiative was set up in 2018 by acatech, the German National Academy of Science and Engineering, in collaboration with SYSTEMIQ. * See consumption and CO2 data, p. 138 see graphic 2.01 End-of-life vehicle recovery and recycling We do not consider end-of-life vehicles as waste to be dis-posed of, but as a secondary source of raw materials. There-fore, we promote the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, com-ponents and materials in order to reintegrate them into the raw materials cycle. Together with its sales organisations in each country, the BMW Group has installed recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles in 30countriesandoffers environmentally friendly vehicle recycling at more than 2,800 recovery centres. All vehicles brought onto the mar-ket since 2008 meet the global requirements set for the recycling of end-of-life vehicles, components and materi-als. In this way we provide 95 % total recycling, with 85 % reuse and material recycling. GRI 301-3 In order to increase our recycling rate even further, we con-tinuously test recycling concepts for new vehicle compon-ents at our recycling and dismantling centre. Furthermore, we promote the implementation of new technologies, such astherecyclingofbatteriesandcarbonfibrecomponents, through cooperation with research institutes and suppliers. Reusing and recycling batteries Batteries that are no longer suitable for vehicles may be given a new lease of life in stationary storage systems. In this way they can contribute to integrating renewable energy into the power grid, increasing grid stability and reducing electricity costs for the consumer wherever pos-sible. We are also gradually installing battery storage sys-tems at our own sites. For batteries that are no longer suitable even for use as a stationary storage unit, we aim to achieve the highest possible rate of recycling of the valuable resources they contain. In collaboration with the technical university TU Bergakademie Freiberg, the BMW Group has developed aprocedurewhichhasincreasedtherecyclingratesignifi-cantly compared to conventional methods. Here, we want to ensure that resources are not downcycled to low-value secondary materials and, if possible, generate recyclates of suitable quality for producing new lithium-ion batteries.

Once the start-up phase is completed, the plant will have a capacity of up to 175,000 units per year and produce one of the most successful cars of the BMW brand, the BMW 3 Series Sedan. New standards in sustainability From its first full production year, our San Luis Potos plant is expected to become the most resource-efficient plant of the BMW Group. A particular sustainability goal within the context of local conditions is the efficient use of water resources. The site will have the lowest water consumption per vehicle manufactured in the production network. The plant operates BMW Groups first process wastewater-free paint shop. The water required for painting the cars is treated and re-used. Renewable energy sources will supply the plant with completely carbon- free electricity in the future. A part of this electricity is produced by a 70,000 m2 photovoltaic plant on site. Production for the global market With the new plant in Mexico, the BMW Groups production network now spans a total of 31 locations. In line with the BMW Group Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT, the new plant will contribute towards building and maintaining a flexible and high-performing production network as well as a balanced distribution of value creation between Europe, Asia and the Americas. Further key indicators BMW Group CO2 footprint Withoureffortstosupplyalllocationswithcarbon-free electricity, we want to contribute to climate protection. CO2 emissions at the BMW Group locations are generated directly from burning fossil fuels (Scope 1 emissions1) and indirectly through the companys electricity and heat con-sumption (Scope 2 emissions1). Here, we focus on reduc-ing CO2 emissions from our production facilities, which account for around 90 % of these Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Both upstream and downstream in the value chain, we con-tinually reduce emissions caused by the use and disposal of our products, in our supply chain, in transport logistics and by employees commuting to and from work (Scope 3 emissions1). Approximately 70 % of these emissions, cur-rently the largest proportion, are generated during utilisa-tion of the vehicles sold. The emissions generated during Dynamicstechnologiesandourelectrificationstrategy,we are continually reducing the average fleetemissionsofCO2 per km. see chapter 2.1 and chapter 2.2 Around a quarter of Scope 3 emissions are generated in the upstream supply chain. Therefore, we constantly work with our suppliers to look for further possibilities to use ,around2 % of Scope 3 emissions are caused by the global transport volume required to supply our production plants with mater ials, to deliver our vehicles and to supply spare parts to the mar-kets. In order to keep these CO2 emissions to an absolute minimum, we are continuously working on expanding utili-sation of low-carbon energy and transport modes. see chapter 3.3 see graphic 3.17 1 Differentiation between Scope 1, 2, 3 according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership of World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustain-able Development (WBCSD).',\n",

For supplying our Chinese plants, for example, the Trans-Siberian Railway is used as an alternative to air transport, resulting in a reduction of CO2 emissions in the region of 56,000 t. In addition, more than 50 % of vehicles produced leave the BMW Group plants by rail. Furthermore, since the US Continental Distribu-tion Center in Lower Nazareth opened in 2019 we have been able to cut down on overseas transports and procure more material locally in the NAFTA area. As part of the Green Logistics Strategy 2050, we are con-tinuously developing environmentally sustainable logistics concepts in collaboration with freight forwarders, infra-structure operators and producers of commercial vehicles. Implemented projects include a total of nine electric lor-ries, which are used in plant logistics. In October 2019 the BMWGroupranafieldtrialwithanelectriclorryforinter-plant parts distribution.

From 2020, we want to supply all production plants worldwide exclusively with electricity from renewable sources. To this end, we have further expanded our own renewable generation capacities at our sites. In this way, we are contributing in particular towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 ( Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action). By generating our own renewable electricity, we are fur-ther improving our environmental performance. In this way, we also match our stakeholders expectations to keep emissions from vehicle production to a minimum and to use a holistic approach towards implementing sustainabil-ity in the area of mobility. Using renewable energy at our plants We are continuously increasing the use of renewable energy along the entire value chain, focusing in particular on our own plants. In order to decide which renewable energy sources are best suited to a particular location, we carry out country-specificanalysestoevaluatethetechnical, ,weusedifferent technologies and solutions. In this context we prioritise pro-ducing our own renewable energy. If this is not entirely feas ible due to prevailing technical and economic condi-tions, we purchase additional electricity from local renew-able sources if possible. We compensate for the remaining electricity from non-renewable sources by purchasing cer-tificatesoforigin. In 2019, one focus area was the expansion of solar capaci-ties at various sites. New photovoltaic systems were success-fullycommissionedinRayong/THaswellasShenyang/CN plants. A 70,000 m2 solar farm with a capacity of 5 MW was installedatthenewlyopenedSanLuisPotos/MXplant. During its ramp-up phase, the photo voltaic system already supplied almost half of the electricity required for install-ing the production facilities. We purchased the remaining electricity from other suppliers of renewable energy and madeupanyshortfallsbyacquiringcertificates,thusachiev-ing a 100 % carbon-free electricity supply at this site for the reporting period. AndattheRosslyn/ZAplanttheBMW Group has been cooperating since 2015 with the Bio2Wattcompany,which also aims to secure energy supply from renewable sources.

The storage farm is connected to the public electricity grid and can take load offthegridintimesofpeakrenewableenergygeneration. When supply is low, the storage system can feed the elec-tricity back into the grid. In this way the BMW Group con-tributes to keeping the public electricity grids stable. Promoting renewable energy in the supply chain We also promote an increase in the use of renewable energy (Scope 1, 2 and 3), and thus many times the CO2 emis-sions at our own plant locations, is generated at our sup-pliers. This share is set to grow even further due to the Supply Chain Programme of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), we ask our suppliers for details on their CO2 emissions and the share of renewables in their overall energy consump-tion. In addition, we encourage suppliers to set themselves emission targets. see graphic 3.02 see chapter 3.3 Due diligence processes: Central management and local tracking of the use of renewable energies The Real Estate, Facility Management and Corporate Secu-rity unit manages and controls the use of renewable energy in the BMW Group buildings.

Here, we are committed to reaching out beyond our direct suppliers. We believe that we can achieve our objectives in this regard only through con-tinuous and collaborative supplier development and con-sistent supplier management. In addition, we support initiatives for standardising sustainability requirements and introducing monitoring mechanisms, for example in mining and processing critical raw materials, through-out the entire supplier network. With our measures along the supply chain we want to contribute towards fulfilling the UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals (SDGs) 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 10 (Reduced inequalities), 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action). With an estimated share of more than 70 % of all value added, our supplier network1cancontributesignificantly to sustainability within the BMW Group. The increasing complexity of the supply networks presents us with great challenges. With electromobility consistently expanding, our demand for raw materials is changing. These special-ised supply chains can bring with them particular environ-mental and social risks. Therefore, we are working closely with our direct suppliers in order to make our supply chains more transparent. GRI 102-9 Establishing sustainability firmly within the supplier network As one of the pioneers in the automotive sector, we have made sustainability an integral part of our procurement process and an essential purchasing criterion since 2014. Our sustainability requirements apply to all suppliers of production materials as well as service providers. In turn, they are also obliged to forward these requirements to their sub-suppliers. We identify raw materials and other materials that are par-ticularly critical in terms of sustainability. We analyse the impact of these resources on the environment and society along the entire supply chain, develop rawmaterial-specific hedging strategies and carry out pilot projects to increase sustainability performance. see other strategically relevant topics In order to ensure an active transformation towards a sus-tainable supplier network, we seek close collaboration with our suppliers and are committed to their further develop-ment in all aspects of sustainability. To this end, we deliver training, information events and various other activities as part of our development programme. 1 At present, the BMW Group supplier network comprises approximately 12,000 suppliers.

In addition, we want to foster transparency in min-eral supply chains through our membership in the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and other raw material- specificinitiatives. AspartofaspecificworkinggroupoftheGermanAssoci-ation of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the BMW Group helped develop a standardised assessment protocol on labour and social standards. In future, it will be possible to acknowledge and share the results of on-site checks within the supplier network, in order to avoid supplier sites being audited repeatedly and to ensure widespread coverage. Furthermore, the BMW Group has been called into the OECD stakeholder group and the National CSRForum of the German Federal Government. Here, we contribute our experiences with various aspects of sustainability and the procurement of raw material as well as due diligence in supplier networks. see other topics with strategic relevance Addressing resource efficiency and CO2 emissions at our suppliers By encouraging them to participate in the Carbon Disclos ure Projects (CDP) Supply Chain Programme we support our sup-pliersintheireffortstoreducetheimpactoftheirbusiness activities on the climate. At the heart of the programme is annual reporting taking into account a multitude of aspects. In this context, measures for reducing CO2 emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy play an impor-tant role, as do strategic and management-relevant topics such as the integration of climate protection into the cor-porate strategy and active risk management. One example are measures for reducing CO2 emissions in the of the overall CO2 emissions in battery-powered elec-tric vehicles. When the BMW Group and its BMW Bril-liancejointventureawardedthe7 billion-plus contract for supplying battery cells to battery manufacturer CATL, for example, it was agreed that large proportions of elec-tricity from renewable sources in Germany and secondary raw materials must be used by the supplier. The CATL bat-tery cell plant is currently under construction in Erfurt (Germany).

It is our aim that 60 % of our suppliers participating in the CDP Supply Chain programme achieve at least a B rating by 2020 (A is the highest and D is the lowest rating in terms of implementing the CDP criteria). In 2017, we initiated the setting up of a working group within the CDP, in which we have been working in collab-oration with other companies from the automotive sector since 2018 to further advance the implementation of the CDP Supply Chain Programme along the entire supply chain.

We regard this as evidence that the programme is well established at the companies which have been partici-pating for longer periods and that it yields the expected results. Participating suppliers reduced their CO2 emissions by 32 million t in 2019 (2018: 39 million t).

Cobalt Another relevant raw material is cobalt, a key component cobalt are contained in batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. As cobalt mining is associated with high risks, in particular in terms of human rights, we are work-ing towards establishing maximum transparency in the supply chain. We are in constant contact with the battery cell manufacturers and, for some years now, we have asked them to disclose the origin of this raw material.

In a next step, we will restructure our cobalt supply chains. In addition, the BMWGroupwillprocurecobaltforthefifthgenerationof battery cells directly from mines outside the Democratic Republic of Congo, i.e. in Australia and Morocco, from 2020 and make it available to the partners in the supply chain. In this way, we are increasing transparency concerning the origin of this raw material.

In collaboration with BASF SE, Samsung SDI and Samsung Electronics as well as the German develop-ment agency Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenar-beit (GIZ), we are promoting responsible artisanal cobalt mining. Over a three-year period, we are investigating how working and living conditions in small-scale mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be improved. The pro-ject focuses on a pilot mine where cobalt is extracted using artisanal methods. If the project is successful, these approaches can then also be used for other artisanal mines in the long term. Furthermore, we are participating in cross-sector initia-tives, such as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI) and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), in order to increase transparency in the cobalt supply chain and develop measures pertaining to overcoming social and environmental risks. In collaboration with the RMI and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce (CCCMC), we devised anauditingstandardandanauditingprocessforrefiner-iesandsmelters,whicharevalidatedandfurtherrefined audited during the reporting period, 15 more have started the process. see chapter 1.3 In addition, we are actively involved in the Global Battery Alliance, which advocates more sustainability in supply chains for batteries.',\n",

Lithium is mined from hard rock, for example in Australia, as well as from brine deposits, for example in South America. There is some criticism in particular with regard to brine production amid concerns about local groundwater. In order to further increase traceability within the supply chain, BMW has decided to purchase lithium directly, make the lithium available to our partners in the supply chain, in the same way as we do with cobalt. We intend to source 100 % of the lithium hydroxide needed for the high-voltage batteries in our vehicles in this way. When procuring the material, we will continue to ensure that any effectsonthegroundwaterarekepttoaminimum. Copper Withtheelectrificationofourfleet,thedemandforcopper is also on the rise, since large amounts of the material are contained in the vehicles electrical systems as well as the high-voltage battery and the drivetrain. Therefore, we want to assess this supply chain in terms of potential negative effectsontheenvironmentaswellasonsociety. In this context, we have initiated several pilot projects to make the copper supply chain for the vehicles electrical system more transparent. Together with our suppliers DRXLMAIER Group and LEONI AG we have mapped all steps in the supply chain and visited cable production, copper processing and mining locations. We are using the results from these activities to develop solutions in collab-oration with stakeholders from politics, society and industry. Natural rubber Fostering sustainability in the natural rubber supply chains, a raw material which is mainly used in tyre products, is also particularly important to us. The BMW Group has been seeking opportunities for dialogue and collaboration with the relevant stakeholders in this sector for several years. In March 2019, a collaboration between all parties involved in the processing of natural rubber was success-fully established and, at a founding meeting in Singapore, the independent Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR) was set up. The foundation of the GPSNR was ini-tiated by the management of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Tire Industry Project (TIP). At present, more than 50 organisations and institutions are participating in the GPSNR, most of them vehicle or tyre producers, suppliers of natural rubber and NGOs. The BMW Group is the only vehicle manufacturer represented on the executive committee of the GPSNR. All members are committed to environmental protection and improv-ing working conditions, to adhering to improved social and ecological standards and to promoting sustainability with business partners.',\n",

With this in mind, we involved our employees more closely in project implementation, a move that was met with great enthusiasm. Since 2015, the BMW Group has been partnering with the Waves4Water organisation. The aim of this project is to supply families living close to BMW Group locations in Mexico,IndiaandThailandwithwaterfilterssothatthey have better access to clean drinking water. By the end of 2019, the project had resulted in 4,620filtersystemsbeing distributed, from which 462,000 people living in the direct proximity of BMW Group locations benefited. Over 300employeeshelpedtodistributewaterfiltersintheir communities. Since 2011, the company has also awarded the BMW Group AwardforCorporateCitizenshiptoemployeeswhostand out for their voluntary work, thus making an important contribution to society. The annual award is under the patronageoftheChiefHumanResourcesOfficerofthe BMW Group. In addition, the Doppelfeld Foundation set up by the former BMW Board member and Supervisory Board Chair Volker Doppelfeld awards a special prize for particularly dedicated young employees. The winners receiveprizemoneyof5,000 each, which they can use for a dedicated purpose. BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt: fostering responsible leadership The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt is an independent corporate foundation whose activities contribute towards the BMW Groups corporate citizenship and mission. The foundation encourages leaders worldwide to take action asResponsibleLeaderstohelpshapeapeaceful,justand sustainable future. These activities are also designed to sup-port the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The requirements of the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR RUG) obligate Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) to publish a non-financial report at company and Group level. This will be published as an integrated, separate non-financial Group report within this Sustain-able Value Report. The legally required information will be provided in the chapter sub-sections on the beige-coloured pages. If information only applies to parts of the BMW Group (e.g. to BMW AG), this will be indicated in the text. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive Option. GRI 102-54 see chapter 1.1 Main topics Based on the results of the materiality analysis updated in 2018 in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as well as with the current long-term sustainability goals of the BMW Group, we derived the main topics to be complied with pursuant to the CSR Directive Implemen-tation Act (CSR RUG). Both our own business activities, productsandservicesaswellasbusinessrelationships,e.g. along the supply chain, were taken into consideration. The topics of high relevance are presented in the integrated, separatenon-financialreport. The order of the topics described is aligned with the long-term sustainability goals of the BMW Group and does not represent any particular weighting of the topics. An over-view of the information on the main topics that is relevant to the legislation is presented at the beginning of each sub-section of the respective chapter.

Boards responsibility for climate-related risks and opportunities. Disclose the organisations governance around climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors is the highest entity with direct responsibility for climate change matters. The Board determines the strategic direction with regard to sus-tainability topics and climate change. Every document submitted to the Board for decision must include a sustainability assessment of the planned project and/or the alternatives presented for decision. B. The role of management in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. All Board members are responsible for climate-related topics and ensure that the strategic direction with regard to sustainability is implemented more systematically as a driver in all Board divisions. With reference to CDP Questionnaire C1.1b C1.2, C1.2a Strategy A. A.

As the industry is significantly affected by future regulatory requirements, manufac-turers that implement sustainability strategies at an early stage can gain a competi-tive edge through lower ongoing development costs and benefit from higher sales due to earlier market penetration. Increasing demand for vehicles with efficient and new technologies that comply Shifts in consumer preferences towards CO2-efficient and sustainable products and Improved access to capital due to the increasing significance of sustainability on the with CO2 regulations. services. capital market. Main risks: Emissions requirements (e.g. from EU28, USA and China) are implemented and force the automotive industry to adapt its products. Further requirements focus on taxation of vehicles on the market. Interruptions in the supply chain due to environmental and weather-related Changes linked to natural resources that lead to bottlenecks in the availability damage. of raw materials. B. Impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisations businesses, strategy and financial planning. The necessity of combatting climate change has a high impact both on the short-term and long-term decision-making processes of the BMW Group. Examples of strategic decisions taken in the past can be found in the CPD chapters. C. Resilience of the organisations strategy The BMW Group carries out stress tests using qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analyses; product planning, sales volumes and R&D investments take account of the Paris Agreement climate targets. A detailed assessment of the resilience of the or-ganisations strategy can be found in our CDP answers. C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4a, C2.5, C2.6, C3.1, C3.1c, C3.1d C3.1a, C3.1d',\n",

A. The organisations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks The Group Risk Management unit is formally organised as a localised company-wide network and is managed by a central risk management function. Material risks re-ported by the network are initially presented for review and then classified according to the level of their impact on the result and/or on the risk-bearing capacity. In addition, topics that may bring opportunities and risks to our business, today or in the future, are determined using an environmental radar, that enables continuous observation of external changes. B. The organisations processes for managing climate-related risks Risks and opportunities are logged, monitored and managed depending on their probability and potential threat for the company, or they are avoided completely. Methods have been developed to address each of the material risks identified. C. Integration of processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks into the organisations overall risk management The process of identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing climate-related risks is integrated into the company-wide risk management process. A. Metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities The Sustainable Value Report offers an overview of key sustainability indicators that the BMW Group uses to measure, monitor and manage risks related to climate change. As CO2 emissions are of key significance for the assessment of climate-re-lated issues, we consider Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as well as the emissions (gCO2 / km) of the new vehicle fleet as key metrics. B. Disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions Further information can be found in the CDP chapters as well as in graphic G3.02 CO2 footprint of BMW Group in the SVR 2019, p.70. C. Targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities In its Strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT, the BMW Group set itself ten sustainability goals (SVR 2019, p.11). These goals relate among other things to climate-related topics such as resource scarcity, CO2 emissions, e-mobility, climate-neutral energy procurement etc. In addition, further short and long-term goals were set to manage Scope 1-3 emissions. 1 These references correspond to Table 1: Allocation of CDP questions to TCFD recommen-dations in section three of the official TCFD Report CDP Technical Note on the TCFD Disclosing in line with the TCFDs Recommendations in 2019 C2.2b, C2.2c C2.2d C2.2 C4.2, C9.1 C6.1, C6.3, C6.5 C4.1, C4.1a, C4.1b, C4.2',\n",
