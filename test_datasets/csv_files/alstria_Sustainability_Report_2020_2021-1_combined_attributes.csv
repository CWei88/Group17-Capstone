"As a side effect, it is an important contribution to protecting carbon sinks and biodiversity, as we aim to manage the forest in a sustainable way.
Creating change and impact Climate risk is the single largest systemic risk to which we are exposed.

Our main objective through forest acquisition is to secure long-term access to timber and other wood construction materials, which are critical to our ability to deliver on our business.

Should it be spent on financially non-viable projects that would reduce the carbon impact?
The company identifies projects with a positive envi-ronmental impact that would not be financed based on financial criteria only.
These systemic risks include but are not lim-ited to climate refugees, political instability, and global supply chain disruptions, which are likely to impact us sooner and more frequently than any of the direct risks described above.
They address what we perceive as a more systemic risk and highlight that we are conscious of the impact of our operations on nega-tive externalities.
We are targeting improving the resil-ience of the forest by introducing more diversity in the tree mix (including increasing native species) and in the harvesting approach.",8

GHG emissions accounting In line with the operational approach of the GHG Proto-col Standard, we divide our carbon emissions into three categories: Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions (Dir) resulting from our companys vehicles and gas heating in our corpo-rate offices.
Responding to the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) We also benchmark our performance against the decar-bonization pathway (expectations) of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which is a partnership among the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).",14

"Dealing with ESG risks in the supply chain The Environmental, Social and Governance ESG risk pro-file of alstrias supply chain is structurally low because of the following characteristics: We operate only in Germany, and all our Tier 1 sup-pliers work under German law for us.
Further-more, for our portfolios emissions from district heating, we used factor data from our regional district heating suppliers.
Most of our regional and municipal district heating suppliers have announced decarbonization strategies that include the following: increasing the share of renewables in district heating, and phasing out coal by 2030 at the latest; including industrial waste heat and waste incineration in the energy mix; developing thermal energy aquifer stor-age to allow for summer and winter heat exchange; and building power-to-heat and hydrogen plants to allow surplus solar and wind power for heat.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol establishes comprehensive, standardized global frameworks with which to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions from private-and public-sector operations, value chains, and mitigation actions.
The separa-tion, disposal, and recycling (waste management plan) of construction and demolition waste is part of the service (and fixed price) that our suppliers deliver for us.
Thus, the ESG conduct of our suppliers is thoroughly screened and strongly enforced by Germanys numerous, compre-hensive ESG compliance regulations.
We discharge freshwater through municipal water suppliers.
While these are largely considered as Scope 3 emissions and usually disregarded as emitted by someone else in the value chain, they represent the lions share of our business impact on climate change.",25
