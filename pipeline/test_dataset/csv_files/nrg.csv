Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are certificates that represent the environmental attributes related to generating one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity from renewable sources.
"When purchased alongside fossil-fired energy, RECs guarantee that equivalent energy was produced using renewable sources and added to the electricity grid."
Organizations can purchase RECs from NRG in a fixed amount or to match the entirety (or a percentage) of their electricity consumption.
Carbon Offsets are used to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions of a household or organization due to its combustion of fossil fuels.
One carbon credit equals one metric ton of greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Carbon offsets are generated by activities such as planting trees or capturing methane from landfills and wastewater treatment facilities.
"The purchaser of a carbon offset can retire it to claim a reduction in their emissions, thereby helping meet their emission reduction goals."
"NRG sells certified carbon offsets to offset customers consumption of natural gas in their homes and businesses, gasoline from their personal vehicles and company fleets, and personal and business travel."
"Like RECs, customers can purchase carbon offsets in any quantity or to match their consumption from a specific usage."
Choosing to fuel vehicles with electricity instead of gasoline and pairing that electricity consumption with a renewable source are key levers to materially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We are helping both individuals and businesses reduce their transportation-related emissions by increasing our supply of renewable electricity and assisting with personal and fleet vehicle electrification.
"To learn more about customers interest in fleet electrification, NRG partnered with Smart Energy Decisions and published The State of Vehicle Fleet Electrification, an industry-first study examining the transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to electrified vehicles for organizations."
Sustainability and environmental goals were among the top customer priorities driving fleet electrification.
"In the study, an overwhelming 86% of more than 200 respondents expressed some level of interest in fleet electrification."
"While environmental drivers were the top priority, cost remains a consideration, especially among commercial operators."
Other significant factors included compliance and evolving technology.
"The study highlights that organizations are at different phases of EV adoption, even with fleet electrification goals gaining momentum."
"In October 2021, NRG hosted the annual Electric Vehicle Ride & Drive Event in partnership with Sustainable Princeton."
We were onsite providing trusted advice and information to potential customers on energy-related products and services that support a sustainable lifestyle.
"Partnerships in success In 2021, we helped many businesses meet their energy goals and acknowledged their achievements."
"In November, our Excellence in Energy Awards recognized nine winning customers in three key areas: sustainability, energy efficiency, and the community."
This event celebrates forward-thinking companies finding innovative ways to build a better energy future.

"In addition to serving our own gas-fired power plant requirements, our gas business helps over one million residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers satisfy their natural gas requirements in the most reliable and economic fashion, according to their unique circumstances."
NRG also works to help customers reduce the carbon footprint associated with their gas consumption where so desired.
These solutions include a suite of tools currently in the market and in development.
One example of an in-market product is our carbon offset offering which allows all of NRGs customer segments to offset their natural gas consumption.
Natural gas is an important part of todays energy mix.
NRG supports the continued use of natural gas as part of a diversified and evolving suite of energy sources that will become less carbon intense over time.
"In particular, NRG supports the evolution of the natural gas industry to advance emerging lower carbon forms of gas like renewable natural gas (RNG), certified responsibly sourced gas (RSG), and hydrogen that can help households, companies, and state and local governments achieve their climate goals."
"We actively participate in industry groups, like the Natural Gas Supply Collaborative, which are working to further the use of lower carbon forms of natural gas and in particular reduce the methane intensity of the natural gas supply chain."
"Whether generating power from our fleet with diverse fuel sources and in geographic proximity to our customers, purchasing power from the market, or entering long-term PPAs for renewables, were sourcing power in ways that meet our customers needs and values."
"Knowing that our customers increasingly want sustainable energy solutions to satisfy stakeholders and reduce cost, we have made significant progress in rebalancing our generation fleet to better serve our residential, commercial, and industrial customers."
"Our asset-light renewable strategy leverages our market expertise in partnering with developers to bring new, additional renewables to the grid through short-and medium-term PPAs."
"As of March 31, 2022, 45% of these renewable PPAs are currently in service, with the remaining expected to come online in the next couple of years."
This asset-light approach to procuring renewables allows us to stay agile to meet customer needs for sustainable energy solutions as they evolve while supporting our business strategy.
"As depicted in the pie charts, when our renewable PPAs come online, the share of renewables in our energy supply portfolio will rise from 1% to 14%."
We expect this share to continue to grow as we divest or retire non-core fossil generation assets.
"NRGs owned generation capacity (Figure A) served approximately one-third of the 157 TWh of electricity sold in 2021, while the remaining two-thirds was served by third-party market purchases of electricity for resale."
See Form 10-K of our 2021 Annual Report for further details.
Both charts exclude market purchases of electricity for resale.
"DATA AND ANALYTICS Data is core to optimizing both energy production and consumption, and NRG is uniquely positioned at the intersection of energy supply and demand."
"As we become ever-more consumer centric, data plays a growing role, and we have a distinct opportunity to use it for more effective decision-making and innovative product and service development for our customers."
"To meet individual customer needs and improve customer experience, we use data and analytics to help predict total electricity demand, time of use patterns, and to identify additional opportunities for simplification and automation ensuring our offerings are as customized as possible."
"In our natural gas business, our highly accurate forecasting processes help mitigate utility balancing charges when supplying gas to utilities for our customers."
"Through robust infrastructure and smart meter data, among other tools, we can transform how we interact with our customers and propel them to make informed energy decisions, enabling them to meet their clean energy objectives."
"For our power plants, data and analytics help forecast total fuel needs as well as optimize their use of different fuel types."

"The workplace of the future Beyond the physical distancing and safety protocols implemented during the global pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that other aspects of the workplace need to evolve as well."
One of our 2021 company goals was to redefine NRG's workplace of the future by transforming how and where we work.
We established a cross-functional group to determine the ongoing COVID-19 response and office protocols for the new working normal.
"Like many companies, we pivoted to a hybrid model, allowing our office-based employees to split their time working from home and office according to the companys needs and their teams needs."
"NRG implemented a flexible model with a range from fully remote, to one to four days in the office, to fully onsite."
"Build a talent agenda that supports business strategy, where employees feel empowered and supported, regardless of work location."
TALENT Design real estate space and a work environment that supports talent strategy and maximizes productivity.
SPACE & PLACE Establish recommendations to build and maintain our culture in the digital workplace transition.
"CULTURE TECHNOLOGY Enhance technology to support our talent agenda, processes, and ways of working, focusing on mobility, collaboration, and a safe infrastructure."
Develop processes that support the new way of working.
"Rewrite policies to better reflect the overall environment, controls, and guidelines."
PROCESS & POLICY Balanced physical and virtual workspaces to promote both human interaction and virtual flexibility.
"Provided safety tips to improve physical and mental well-being like stretching exercises, virtual workout classes, and access to telemedicine options."
We are continually evaluating safety practices to ensure all programs satisfy regulatory requirements.
"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, power plant-based employees continued reporting to their respective work locations."
"However, our Safety-Over-Production policy prioritizes all safety rules and requirements, even if generation facilities must stop production."
"It is our goal to achieve top decile safety performance each year for Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), which is defined as the number of work-related injuries per 100 full-time workers during a one-year period."
Below is a full list of plant locations with zero recordables and facilities with OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star1 status.
"Facilities in the OSHA VPP Star Program have achieved injury and illness rates at or below the national average for the Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Industry."
"We provide programs that holistically support physical, emotional, and financial wellness, allowing our colleagues the opportunity to take control of their well-being and focus on what matters most to them for a healthy, secure future."
"Through walking challenges, webinars on nutrition, our Quit for Life tobacco cessation program, and financial rewards for taking certain actions to support a healthy lifestyle, NRG provides a variety of programs and tools to allow employees to best support their physical well-being."
"Mental and emotional health is vital to all employees, and something we continue to prioritize through various programs and initiatives."
"Through various partnerships and programs, our vast selection of mental health-focused benefits aims to help our employees in areas of life that become stressful or overwhelming."
Mental Health First Aiders are NRG employees that act as mental health ambassadors and are trained to support colleagues who may be experiencing mental health challenges.
They help find a trusted support professional for anyone seeking self-care.
"NRG also offers back up care for children and elders through Bright Horizons, adoption assistance, Progyny Fertility services, ReThink Developmental Disabilities Support, and various counseling and emotional support resources and programs through our Employee Assistance Program (EAP)."
"NRG partners with BrightPlan, Fidelity, and Bank of America to offer financial education on retirement planning, mortgages, and more."
"A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN THRIVE A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN THRIVE We recognize that we must live our values to serve our customers and communities and one of NRGs Power Values is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion."
NRGs safe and supportive environment elevates every employees unique background and voice.
"Here, we engage different perspectives to solve complex challenges together."
Investing in our people Acquiring and retaining top talent is a priority for us.
"Not only do we continuously evaluate our job opportunities to ensure theyre competitive, we also: Mitigate unconscious biases in the hiring process by removing resume details that may convey a candidates gender identity, race, religion, or socioeconomic background."
Implement more inclusive corporate hiring practices such as eliminating degree requirements where appropriate.
"Seek to provide competitive levels of compensation and benefits, as benchmarked against peers, to ensure incentives are properly aligned with business needs and to enable us to attract and retain qualified employees."
"The next generation of energy engineers and sustainability practitioners In collaboration with Prairie View A&M, a historically black college and university in Texas, NRG launched an initiative to support the university's engineering program and provide students hands-on learning opportunities with NRG executives and industry subject matter experts."
"This climate-focused course opportunity has recently expanded from mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering to include the agriculture, chemical, and civil engineering disciplines."
"A key outcome of the course is the empowerment of underrepresented engineering students with the commercial dexterity necessary to apply artificial intelligence and data analytics education to real world decarbonization challenges, engineering problems, and business issues."
"Through weekly engagement with industry stakeholders and NRG subject-matter experts, these students also become candidates for NRGs summer internship program where they can use what theyve learned first-hand within our business."
"This collaborative program challenges students to translate and leverage their knowledge and skills to unearth data-driven solutions in conventional power generation operations, renewable energy technology, Nature Based Solution (NBS), and financial decision making."
Opportunities for veterans Our commitment to service members is deeply rooted in our military hiring initiatives.
"We seek to attract, hire, and help develop veterans to continue bringing the power of energy to people and organizations."
We recently partnered with the Department of Defense (DOD) to create the Patrol to Power program.
"Part of the DOD SkillBridge initiative, Patrol to Power helps transitioning military personnel enter the civilian workforce while providing valuable experience and skills in the energy industry."
The Patrol to Power program is an opportunity for service members to participate in a 12-week internship to gain civilian work experience they can parlay into a full-time role.
Our goal is to help transitioning service members convert their military skills and experience into a meaningful career at NRG.
Service members' military talents and characteristics add value to our workforce and organization.
The transition from service member to civilian could occur after one tour of duty or a decades-long military career.
"No matter when the change, we have found considerable alignment between the technical skills of Armed Forces personnel and energy operations."
Veterans individual accountability and past teamwork are also invaluable assets for business leaders.
"A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN THRIVE Cultivating talent We are committed to developing leaders who can refine and execute our strategy, driving value for our stakeholders."
"Management regularly updates its leadership and succession plans, including engaging with the Board to identify candidates for key senior leadership positions."
"When employees are valued, feel heard, and are empowered daily, we foster a successful, collaborative environment."
We are dedicated to improving our companywide employee experience and cultivating internal talent for career progression and development.
Our goals are to empower each employee to be their authentic self and provide a space of belonging in the workplace.
"But, with DE&I a core value of NRG, we believe we hold a collective responsibility to educate ourselves and to act so that we can hold ourselves accountable."
"The Emerging Leaders Program (ELP) is just one example of how NRG is developing our valued, high-potential employees into the leaders of the future."
"The current ELP cohort is comprised of some of NRGs future leaders, representing every part of our business."
"The group reflects various dimensions of diversity including gender, race and ethnicity, educational background, and professional experience."
"For one year, the cohort is working on active, NRG business-critical projects where their impact will be felt for years to come."
"In their second and final year, the cohort will mentor the next group, furthering the leadership development pipeline at NRG."
Building the team of the future Theres no denying that the best teams are diverse teams.
"Executive Vice President, NRG Business, Robert Gaudette is leading the charge to cultivate upcoming talent and build teams where all voices are elevated."
"Champions of diversity in the energy space, Robert and his team are longtime supporters of Rice Universitys Women in Leadership and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) conferences."
"Conference attendees participate in panel discussions and interactive workshops, explore various approaches to leadership, and discuss future opportunities to accomplish their career goals."
"To build the next generation of leadership, NRG Business launched a mentoring program called Learn from Leaders which is cultivating leadership from within the company."
"Our employee-led business resource groups (BRGs) help employees embrace their unique knowledge, skills, and perspectives."
A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN THRIVE Just transition In the event of a large downsizing at a plant (or a plant closure) our plant operations leadership takes a proactive approach to ensuring that employees are aware of upcoming changes with as much notice as possible and are aware of all options available to them during the transition.
"These include meeting with union leadership, if applicable, on the effects of the transition, meeting with all impacted employees to assess if they are interested in another role at NRG, ensuring impacted employees are aware of job openings at the company, giving preference to displaced qualified internal employees for open roles at other plants and, when the employee is willing, offering to relocate impacted employees to take those roles."
"In addition, NRG offers outplacement services, resume writing skills workshops, and tuition assistance for retraining."
Championing diversity Pursuing DE&I is an ongoing effort at NRG.
"We are building a unified and inclusive culture, where a strong sense of belonging leads to better collaboration and business performance."
Our unconscious bias training for all employees had a 100% completion rate and all members of our executive management team have completed extensive inclusion sessions.
"Our work is never done, and we are expanding employee learning on DE&I in 2022."
"Our DE&I council, led by President and CEO Mauricio Gutierrez, was a 21-member, cross-functional team established in 2020 to develop actionable recommendations that enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion at NRG."
The Councils recommendations were shared with our Board and many were implemented in 2021.
The Councils efforts were critical to jumpstarting our DE&I efforts at NRG and leading our engagement with the communities we serve and the employees we value.

"Together we empower healthy choices, promote community resilience, and support sustainable practices through philanthropy and volunteering."
All of our social responsibility efforts reflect a leadership-by-example approach.
"Volunteer opportunities included virtual events, unloading food deliveries at local food pantries, packaging Thanksgiving meals, and building a community garden."
"Our employees donated more than 100,000 pounds of food and packed over 74,000 meals."
"In the wake of Winter Storm Uri, we committed $10 million to provide relief for our fellow Texans."
Relief resources included $3 million in cash donations and $7 million covering in-kind relief efforts and customer assistance.
"The funding aimed to address three key areas: support immediate community needs, provide financial relief for customers, and aid affected employees."
"In late summer, Hurricane Ida, a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane, struck the East Coast causing historic flooding and destruction."
"NRG donated $20,000 to the American Red Cross in Philadelphia to support disaster relief efforts including clean up, shelters, and providing financial assistance to people in the surrounding areas where many of our customers live and work, and in New Jersey where many of NRGs employees are based."
"In 2002, Green Mountain Energy founded Sun Club."
"By investing in the planet through sustainable solutions, conservation initiatives, and educational programs, Sun Club helps nonprofit organizations create a cleaner, brighter future."
"Earthshare Texas Launched in 2011, Reliant EcoShareSM allows customers to use their electricity bill to support EarthShare Texas and purchase carbon offsets."
EarthShare Texas is a non-profit federation that supports more than 30 different local and statewide environmental organizations.
"With help from customer contributions, in 2021 the program reached the milestone of raising $2 million since its inception."
"All carbon offsets for the Reliant EcoShareSM program meet approved standards to ensure that they represent real, verifiable reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."
"In 2021, EcoShareSM offset over 97 million pounds of CO2, the equivalent GHG emissions from driving an average gasoline-powered car about 110 million miles."
We also believe in providing transparency on our approach to managing climate-related impacts across our business and operations.
"Our goals NRG is targeting a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2025, from our current 2014 baseline, and net-zero emissions by 2050."
"Our goal covers NRGs direct emissions (scope 1), its purchased energy (scope 2), and the employee business travel portion of scope 3."
"NRG is the first, and currently the only, power company in North America to achieve this designation and among only twelve globally at the time of certification."
"To further strengthen our sustainability commitments, in 2021 NRG added a new sustainability goal to achieve 100% electrification of our light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030."
"As part of this goal, we joined the Climate Groups EV100, a global initiative which brings together companies committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030."
The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and a market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas.
"As compared to 2020, the increase in emissions in 2021 was primarily due to higher power demand which was a result of the easing of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the associated economic recovery."
We are continuing to target a 50% reduction by 2025 and are on track to meet that goal.
"NRG's Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses NRG generation from all fuels represented in our portfolio-natural gas, coal, nuclear, oil, and renewables."
"A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 2004 and are assured by a third party."
We are committed to operating in an environmentally responsible manner and in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements.
Our Environment-Over-Production policy sets a clear understanding that environmental compliance takes precedence over production at NRG.
Every employee is empowered and encouraged to take the necessary steps to maintain environmental compliance.
Our Environmental Policy Statement can be found here.
"As part of our ongoing operations, we carefully measure and track monthly compliance with environmental requirements and our own more stringent standards using our environmental key performance indicators (EKPIs)."
"These EKPIs measure leading and lagging indicators such as notices of violation (NOVs), reportable spills, and compliance with laws, and are reported internally to management and our Board, as well as externally here in our annual Sustainability Report."
Our record in continual improvement is exemplary and measurable.
"Site-specific EKPI performance impacts the compensation of all employees at that site, fostering collective accountability and environmental commitment within the workforce."
"Before a plant can receive credit for its performance, it must pass through an environmental ""gate,"" which requires completion of one or more proactive initiatives to minimize the environmental footprint of the site."
"To continuously improve environmental performance, we use an Environmental Management Information System called Intelex to track, assign responsibility, and report on all associated environmental tasks and requirements whether internally or externally driven."
Intelex provides us the tools and transparency to efficiently track our environmental performance.
"We use Intelex Incident Management, Corrective Actions, and root cause applications to report incidents, analyze root causes, and ensure completion of corrective actions."
The NRG Environmental Manual directs personnel at all NRG facilities to maintain environmental compliance in all activities and processes.
"In 2021, we used both internal resources and an independent auditing firm to conduct environmental audits at several of our facilities."
Our audit program requires prompt completion of preventive as well as corrective actions if any issues are identified.
"Our Environmental Management System (EMS) encompasses our overall program including the EKPI, site audits, Intelex, and standard policies and procedures."
The figure to the right illustrates significant overall improvement in environmental compliance performance since 2014.
"While our performance trend shows continued improvement since 2014, in 2021 we saw an increase in EKPIs resulting from a combination of events, including more generation operating hours, increased enforcement, and natural variation in small data sets as the number of assets in our portfolio has declined over time."
Notices of Violation A Notice of Violation (NOV) is a formal written notification from an environmental regulatory agency that a noncompliance event by the company has been identified.
"It can be issued for any violation of law, regulation, permit, certification, or license, regardless of significance."
"An NOV may or may not result in a fine; historically, the vast majority of NOVs issued to NRG have not included a fine."
"Any NOV issued to NRG, whether valid or disputed, is recorded as an incident in our EKPI process."
"Our environmental performance metric counts environmental incidents such as reportable spills, permit deviations, and receipts of NOV."
"Fewer incidents results in a lower, more favorable score."
"The chart shows the companys EKPI score by year as a percentage of baseline year 2014, which is indexed to 100%."
Baselines have been recalculated to reflect the composition of the NRG generation fleet.
"In some cases, that has resulted in differences from percentages previously reported."
"In the charts above, all assets sold as of December 31, 2021 have been removed from inventories."
AIR EMISSIONS We integrate environmental considerations into strategic and operational decisions.
We have demonstrated our commitment by reducing our impact on the environment in several areas.
Our annual SOx and NOx air emissions have declined significantly over the last seven years.
"Operating some of our power generation facilities depends on having enough available fresh, recycled, brackish, or ocean water to cool condensers during electricity power generation and to provide water to boilers to produce steam for the turbines that produce electricity."
"We have designed our approach to water management with the understanding that water issues (usage, scarcity, quality, and biodiversity) are site-specific."
"Strategies and practices to mitigate water risks, as well as various water management metrics, are contained within our SASB standards table."
We invest in water-saving technologies when cost effective such as cooling towers that reduce water consumption and environmental impact.
"We also reduce our use of fresh water by using non-potable water such as brackish water, grey water from sewage treatment plants, leachate collection systems, and by reusing water in plant cooling and process systems."
"We work to reduce, reuse, and recycle any material used in our daily operations to help preserve natural resources."
These actions also affect our bottom line and operational efficiency.
The scope of our waste management programs includes both corporate offices and generation facilities and the information below focuses on e-waste (such as old computers and other electronic products) and on non-hazardous and hazardous waste from our generation facilities.
The amounts generated each year vary with the activities of the organization and its facilities.
"In 2021, we continued to enhance the current waste diversion program by evaluating waste generated and identifying recycling opportunities."
"Coal combustion residuals are used in industrial applications such as on-and off-plant road construction, as well as in materials such as cement, gypsum board, roofing shingles, and other applications."
"This practice reduces the need for mining of virgin resources such as native soil, gravel, and gypsum."
"In April of 2015 (amended in 2018 and 2020), the EPA promulgated a rule which regulates the disposal of CCRs and beneficial use activity, a rule implemented in addition to existing state solid and liquid waste and beneficial use regulations."
"We maintain a CCR Rule compliance data and information website that provides information on our CCR facilities, our CCR management practices, and monitoring data."
The amount of water consumed at non-generation facilities is immaterial in comparison.
"As organizational boundaries change, we will evaluate whether to include that consumption in future inventories."
The volumes reported for 2020 have also been revised due to incomplete data at the time of publication in June 2021.
"In some cases, that has resulted in differences from beneficial use percentages from previous reports."
Reported numbers for 2020 include material from a cleaned out bottom ash pond at one facility.
We strive to maintain a position of leadership in supplier diversity among energy and energy services companies.
Our core values provide the basis for our business decisions and drive our commitment to diversity within our supply chain.
"We ensure that diverse business enterprises such as those that are small, minority-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned have open access to contracting opportunities available at NRG."
"In 2021, we continued advancing transparency and disclosure by participating in the world-leading CDP Supply Chain engagement program."
"Once a year, we ask our top suppliers to disclose information about their climate change performance."
"In 2021, NRG earned an A-, Leadership Level, for our Supplier Engagement."
"This years data shows that consistent engagement from purchasers creates momentum in key areas Corporate buyers have the ability to make change happen at the required scale and speed CDP Global Supply Chain Report 2021 In 2021 compared to 2020, the percentage of spend with small business and diverse suppliers increased from 12% to 20%."
We are also formally measuring subcontracted small business and diverse business spend for our top 25 suppliers and intend to increase this number of top suppliers annually.
Read our CEO supplier diversity commitment letter on our website.
NRG has a robust Supplier Code of Conduct as well as a manufacturing standards policy.
We require all contract manufacturers (including subcontractors) to adhere to our Social Responsibility Standards for Manufacturers Policy.
"Third-party audits are conducted regularly, and NRG reports the results of such third-party manufacturing audits to the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors."
Third-party audits are conducted regularly and NRG reports the results of such third-party manufacturing audits to the Boards Audit Committee.
Manufacturers who employ subcontractors shall verify that these standards are upheld by their subcontractors.
These standards are referenced and made part of any manufacturing contract agreed by NRG.
"To manage compliance with these standards, manufacturers are encouraged to establish policies and performance objectives related to labor, grievances, health and safety, environmental responsibility and ethics, and business integrity."
Read the full policy here.
"The energy sector is making progress toward a clean energy future, and NRG has reduced its direct carbon footprint by 44% since 2014."
"However, new and enhanced processes and technology will be required for further, sector-wide decarbonization."
"While the share of coal in the power generation fuel mix has declined over time, natural gas remains an important input to the generation of baseload power."
"It is also an important direct source of energy for many homes and businesses, and as discussed in the Customers chapter, NRG is a retailer of natural gas to over one million customers."
"Although natural gas emits around 50% less CO2 than coal when combusted, the methane emissions associated with the natural gas supply chain are 86 times 1."
This finding enabled us to craft strategies that address our most significant areas of impact and the vendors that comprise the largest portion of our supply chain footprint.
"As a result, in 2017 we became a founding member of the Natural Gas Supply Collaborative (NGSC), a voluntary collaborative of natural gas purchasers promoting increased transparency through voluntary reporting by natural gas producers."
NGSC members include some of the largest natural gas purchasers in North America.
"Collectively, NGSC participants deliver enough natural gas to meet the needs of more than 60 million households and generate enough electricity from natural gas to power almost 29 million households2."
"Operating at the intersection of the natural gas supply chain and end-use customers, NGSC participants including NRG are increasingly being asked about the carbon footprint, particularly the methane emissions, associated with their natural gas supply chains."
"Most recently, the NGSC has been reviewing various voluntary standards that aim to certify natural gas as responsibly sourced."
"This gas is known as responsibly sourced gas (RSG) or, equivalently, producer-certified gas (PCG)."
"As part of this process, the NGSC has engaged with the relevant certification bodies, with producers that have certified their gas as responsibly sourced, and with pipeline companies seeking to facilitate the transportation and transaction of such RSG / PCG."
"As it becomes commercially viable, NRG plans to offer RSG / PCG to its customers to help them achieve their sustainability goals and will evaluate using this for its own power generation as well."
"This harm is measured by global warming potential (GWP), which in turn is measured over different time horizons."
"For methane, its GWP over 20 years is 86, while over 100 years it is 34."
"In other words, it has a particularly potent impact in the first two decades after being emitted."

"Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about NRGs future revenues, income, indebtedness, capital structure, plans, expectations, objectives, projected financial performance and/or business results and other future events, and views of economic and market conditions."
"Although NRG believes that its expectations are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct, and actual results may vary materially."
"Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated herein include, among others, general economic conditions, hazards customary in the power industry, weather conditions and extreme weather events, competition in wholesale power and gas markets, the volatility of energy and fuel prices, failure of customers or counterparties to perform under contracts, changes in the wholesale power and gas markets, changes in government or market regulations, the condition of capital markets generally, our ability to access capital markets, the potential impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic on the Companys operations, financial position, risk exposure and liquidity, data privacy, cyberterrorism and inadequate cybersecurity, unanticipated outages at our generation facilities, adverse results in current and future litigation, failure to identify, execute or successfully implement acquisitions or asset sales, our ability to implement value enhancing improvements to plant operations and companywide processes, our ability to achieve our net debt targets, our ability to achieve or maintain investment grade credit metrics, our ability to proceed with projects under development or the inability to complete the construction of such projects on schedule or within budget, the inability to maintain or create successful partnering relationships, our ability to operate our business efficiently, our ability to retain retail customers, our ability to realize value through our market operations strategy, the ability to successfully integrate businesses of acquired companies, including Direct Energy, our ability to realize anticipated benefits of transactions (including expected cost savings and other synergies) or the risk that anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected, and our ability to execute our Capital Allocation Plan."
"NRG undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law."
Our sector is defined as electric utilities and power producers.
"Disclosure quality and transparency, as well as overall sustainability performance, are assessed through ongoing stakeholder feedback, including through investor relations and participation in engagement and disclosure organizations such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which is now known as the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)."
"By adhering to the Financial Stability Boards TCFD recommendations, we are better equipped to inform investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters of climate-related risks, opportunities, and scenarios."
NRG published its inaugural TCFD report in 2021 and intends to update it periodically.
"The content in the TCFD is intended to be complementary to the sustainability report, as part of a broader ESG communication strategy to deliver decision-useful metrics to NRG stakeholders."
"However, some longer-term projects and goals are discussed as are certain significant current events that occurred between the end of 2021 and the time of publication."
"The NRG website also provides visitors the latest news and events on the companys environmental, social and governance initiatives."
Key Issues Assessment NRG strives to report decision-useful information to our stakeholders in an efficient and concise manner.
We recognize that we have many different stakeholder groups which may each require information presented in a variety of ways and on numerous topics.
We engage proactively with our key stakeholders to understand the type of information that is of greatest interest and the processes that will most effectively deliver these data to them.
"However, given the rapidly growing landscape of voluntary sustainability reporting this past decade, we must also focus on compiling the most relevant information while achieving greater transparency each year."
"As part of the above process, we periodically conduct a key issues assessment to ensure that we identify potential strategic and operational risks and opportunities as well as specific sustainability issues that are relevant to our current and potential future business and operating environment."
"The key issues assessment provides a foundation of topics from which to prioritize our sustainability goals and initiatives, build our annual sustainability report, as well as provide insight into emerging issues that our stakeholders care about."
"To conduct the key issues assessment, we monitor the competitive, regulatory, and media landscapes."
"For the purpose of NRGs Sustainability Report, these findings are also compared with external best practice publications on sustainability metrics, such as the Electric Power Research Institutes Metrics for the Electricity Producers Industry, TCFD Recommendations, and the SASB/VRF."
We use this independent analysis to better inform business decisions and shape our voluntary reporting process.
"For the purposes of sustainability reporting, NRG considers the GRI framework to report on issues of importance to the company and its stakeholders."
NRG supports work that contributes directly to providing comparable and consistent data.
The nature of our business directs us to consult the SASB Standards for Infrastructure Sector Electric Utilities as defined by the VRFs Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS).
Below is a table which contains those topics we have identified as key issues and against which we are able to report as a publicly traded company.
Topics that are not applicable to NRG are denoted as such.
"Activity metrics that may assist in the accurate evaluation and comparability of disclosure may be found in NRGs 2021 Form 10-K, NRGs 2021 Proxy Statement, and in NRGs 2021 Sustainability Report."
Quantitative data may be followed by narrative information that contextualizes the data table and is also responsive to any qualitative metrics.
"Reported greenhouse gas metrics include emission and consumption data from all facilities located in the United States that were owned, controlled, or for which the Company had an equity interest as of December 31, 2021."
"A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 2004 (GHG Protocol), to determine facilities within the organizational boundary."
Emissions and consumption data from jointly owned electric generating facilities are allocated based on the Companys equity share of ownership at the plant level.
Note that tolling agreements are currently excluded from the organizational boundary.
"Discussion of accounting, estimations and uncertainty for Scope 1 Emissions: Scope 1 includes only direct GHG emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, turbines, and engines used to produce electric power."
"Scope 1 GHG emissions were determined by using methods specified within Title 40, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 98, Subparts A, C and D of the Code of Federal Regulations."
The determination of the equity share of GHG emissions is consistent with equity share methodologies for equity share accounting for greenhouse gas emissions as described in the GHG Protocol.
"GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels used for other activities or equipment, such as auxiliary boilers, starter engines, and company fleet vehicles are not included at this time as the associated emissions are immaterial."
"Scope 1 emissions do not include emissions from fugitive sources such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) releases from use of refrigeration and/or air conditioning equipment, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from electrical equipment, and methane releases from natural gas transport."
From 2014-2021 our emissions decreased 44%.
Disclosure of our strategy to manage Scope 1 emissions is reported annually through the CDP Climate Change questionnaire as well as in NRGs 2020 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report and NRGs Sustainability Linked Bond Framework.
The requirement to report PM10 emissions in annual emissions inventories or emissions statements varies between states.
"In addition, the earliest reporting deadline for a reporting year is July 1st of the following year."
"In the case of lead and mercury emissions, volumes are estimated for some facilities due to incomplete data at time of publication."
"Percentage of Each in Regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress Water Management Number of Incidents of Non-Compliance with Water-Quality and/or Quantity Permits, Standards, and Regulations Discussion of Water Management Risks NRGs definition of substantive risk from water is the possibility that an event will occur and significantly affect the achievement of NRGs business goals."
Risk identification and assessment process applies to both direct operations and supply chain.
"If determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels at any plant within a two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation."
NRG Plant Operations team reviews modeling scenarios generated.
Plant water usage is reviewed annually.
"Analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG's Operations, Engineering and Commercial Operations teams."
WRI Aqueduct tool is used annually to develop a high level view of basin level risk that informs strategic decision-making and the setting of goals and targets.
This tool was chosen because of its open source nature and ease of use.
Each generating facility is unique and the water risk approach identifies and addresses risks for each covering: Availability Supply chain impacts Quality Financial Regulatory Operational Stakeholders Environmental Risk response decisions are primarily made and executed by managing plant operations to maintain compliance with all regulations.
NRG reports supply chain water risk annually through the CDP Water Risk Questionnaire.
"Near-Miss Frequency Rate The National Safety Agency defined near misses as an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage, but had the potential to do so."
"NRG uses an electronic Incident Management System to document, communicate, track, and trend specific factors about each event including causal factors and corrective actions; this system provides automated fleet-wide notifications."
The number of near-misses is derived from a report pulled from the Incident Management System.
The system also includes notifications to executive management when significant safety events occur that meet the defined criteria for a Significant Event notification.
The system also generates weekly reports to communicate any events from the previous week to NRG personnel.
NRG South Texas Project LP (STP) is a 44% owner of a joint undivided interest in STP.
The NRC license gives NRG the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it.
"In connection with the NRC license, NRG and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to $120 million to support operations at STP."
We also maintained our relationships with groups such as the Electric Power Supply Association and various informal organizations.
"When possible, we collaborate with major environmental groups on clean energy access and climate solutions."
"Typically, we engage on legislative and regulatory actions designed to mitigate GHG emissions, as well as policies that support the development and deployment of competitive low-carbon power generation technologies."
"We are most active in the debate aimed at protecting and expanding competitive power markets and consumer choice, both of which we believe are critical enablers of achieving least-cost low-carbon outcomes."
"This year, we evaluated the climate positions of certain membership organizations to which we belong."
IF101-21 The following SASB topics and corresponding activity metrics are not applicable to NRG.
Energy Affordability (IF-EU-240a.
"This topic pertains to regulated electric utilities, and NRG is not a regulated utility."
End-Use Efficiency & Demand (IF-EU-420a.
Grid Resiliency (IF-EU-550a.
"The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (measured in metric tons) emitted per unit of electricity (measured in a variant of watt hours (terawatt hours, gigawatt hours, megawatt hours, kilowatt hours)."
See also revenue carbon intensity.
Carbon Offset: Mechanism to compensate for the greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions of a household or larger organization due to its combustion of fossil fuels.
An example of a carbon offset is afforestation (planting trees).
Community Solar: Local solar facilities shared and financially supported by multiple community subscribers who might not otherwise be able to access solar.
"Demand Response (DR): A program that provides financial incentives to end-users to reduce their consumption of electricity during periods when the electricity grid is experiencing high electricity demand (for example, when temperatures are very high or very low)."
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): Modular energy generation and storage technologies that provide electric capacity or energy where and when its needed.
"Usually deployed close to load (at the point of customer demand) and behind the customers meter, giving customers greater control, predictability, and stability when it comes to their energy usage."
"Greenhouse Gas (GHG): Traps heat in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming and climate change."
"In the power sector, GHG emissions are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, while producing electricity."
"In the natural gas sector, GHG emissions are released during the production, transportation, and consumption of natural gas."
Measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
"Google Nest Hub: A smart energy product that serves as a virtual assistant for the home, making automation easy and intuitive, especially through voice commands."
"Acts as a command center, uniting home automation devices and simplifying everyday tasks, including home energy management."
"Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): A medium-or long-term contract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller), and one which is looking to purchase electricity (the buyer, either a corporate end-user or a power company reselling the electricity to a corporate end-user)."
"PPAs are often used in renewable energy, especially solar, as a way for buyers to access solar electricity without having to directly install solar generating capacity onsite."
Buyers take ownership of the physical energy and receive renewable electricity credits.
"Revenue Carbon Intensity: The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (measured in metric tons) per unit of revenue (typically measured in a variant of dollars (millions of dollars, thousands of dollars)."
Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA): A variation of a PPA in which the buyer does not take ownership of the physical energy generated.
"Instead, a VPPA is a financial transaction whereby a corporate customer agrees to purchase power at a negotiated price from a wind or solar project over a predetermined number of years, committing to pay a fixed price to the owner of the facility for each unit of electricity produced."
"As with a PPA, the buyer receives renewable electricity credits, but the developer takes responsibility for managing the delivery and sale of the electricity produced on the open market."
Watt (W): A measure of electricity generation capacity at a particular point in time.
"Variants include kilowatts (kW, thousand watts), megawatts (MW, million watts), gigawatts (GW, billion watts), and terawatts (TW, trillion watts)."
Watt Hours (Wh): A measure of the amount of electricity provided over a particular period of time (typically one year or one month).
"Variants include kilowatt hours (kWh, thousand watt hours), megawatt hours (MWh, million watt hours), gigawatt hours (GWh, billion watt hours), and terawatt hours (TWh, trillion watt hours)."
"However, we recognize that some readers may wish to delve deeper into certain topics."
"To facilitate such further reading, the list below is a catalog of the most recent, additional publications spanning our five sustainability pillars."
This list is also posted on NRG's website and will be refreshed as additional reports are published.
We hope this provides an even more complete view of sustainability at NRG.
