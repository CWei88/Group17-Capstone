"SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO Last year, Citycon continued to make progress and got significant recognition for our efforts to achieve our climate goals, while simultaneously working with local governments to provide safe necessity-based services during the on-going pandemic."
"Citycon develops and operates full service urban hubs where people live, work, and shop."
Sustainability and climate leadership remain a cornerstone for our people and key to good business as we strive to create cities full of life.
We continue to excel on our climate goals: We are committed to the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) to reduce 50% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 when compared to our emissions in 2018.
This gave us fresh insight on actions we need to take in the future to reduce them.
We are committed to be a climate industry leader year after year.
"In October, we took part in a Climate Leader survey conducted by The Financial Times and German research company Statista."
The European companies that had achieved the biggest reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions intensity between 2014-2019 were accepted on the list of 300 best performing companies.
We are committed to become carbon neutral by 2030 and we continued working to reach that goal.
"During 2021, we have created our climate neutrality road map to steer our way towards our ambitious targets in carbon neutrality."
"Our assets together with local community leaders will continue promoting energy efficiency, public transport and cycling in our centres."
"At every Citycon centre additionally, we continue emphasising safety and providing services that meet all the needs of our local communities while using the best sustainability technology available today."
Our newest centre Lippulaiva perfectly demonstrates our strategy to transform a unique location into a thriving sustainable community.
"Lippulaiva is based in Espoo, Finland, and will be a state-of-the-art example of our strategy implementation in action with 100 stores, over 500 apartments, and 8 million expected visitors a year."
Lippulaiva will be fully integrated with metro and bus terminal access.
Lippulaiva will be a nearly zero-energy asset right from opening with the largest geothermal heating and cooling facility ever built into a commercial building in Europe.
The facility will generate carbon-free energy to meet the heating and cooling needs of the retail centre and apartments.
Lippulaiva will be fully certified at opening with a LEED Gold Certificate.
"The Lippulaiva development is also part of the EU-funded project SPARCS that aims to demonstrate sustainable and smart energy systems, promoting e-mobility and piloting ways to engage and encourage citizens energy positive behaviour."
We continue supporting the transition to low-carbon economy also through our green financing framework.
We were one of the earliest Nordic real estate companies to commit to sustainable financing.
"In 2021, our green issuances totalled MEUR 700."
Our sustainability and finance teams have also classified our activities by mapping Citycon groups consolidated IFRS income statement accounts based on whether they are covered by a NACE code included in the EUs Taxono-my Regulation Delegated Act.
"As a final note, I would like to thank our employees, tenants, partners, and local community leaders in helping us drive this change that enables sustainable growth for people, businesses, and our society for generations to come."
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE IN ACTION Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and mitigating it is present throughout all our operations.
Through our principle Excellence in action our goal is to make sustainability a norm followed everywhere in our organisation.
"Citycons priorities combine business rele-vance and the most important sustainability issues for our stakeholders, the environment, and the communities we operate in."
One of our Sustainability Strategys main priorities is Excellence in action.
It means that we want to make our best sustainable practices a norm throughout Citycon.
We firmly believe that sustainable business is the only way to make good business.
Our approach has borne fruit.
"In May 2021, we were ranked in the top quarter in Europes Climate Leader Companies survey conducted by the Financial Times and the German research company Statista."
They survey ranked companies according to how much they have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions in relation to their revenues.
"The survey listed over 4,000 European companies from all business fields."
Citycon was the only Finnish real estate company included.
"Following this, in October 2021 we became the first real estate company in Finland to join the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
Joining SBTi is based on their validation.
The validation considered if Citycons climate targets are in line with climate science.
"SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)."
"More than 1,000 businesses all over the world are working with the initiative to reduce their emissions."
Our strategic actions are renewed every three years.
This ensures that we do not stay put but move forward and get things done.
Our achievements in the year 2021 prove that we are on the right path and encourage us to strive further towards our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.
A description of how we create value can be found in our financial review on page 8.
READ MORE Our full Sustainability strategy is available online at sustainability/sustainability-strategy.
Citycons sustainability strategy defines actions and targets which set clear goals for 2030.
"Our work to reach these goals is guided by the concept Excellence in action, which refers to our desire to make best sustainable practices the norm throughout the company."
Our strategy is built around the priority areas of our long-term sustainability promises: Carbon Neutral: Using less energy and producing more of it ourselves.
Long-term main objective: Citycon is carbon neutral by 2030.
Accessible: Encouraging green transportation.
"Long-term main objective: 100% of assets are connected to public transport, encouraging green ways to visit our centres."
"By 2030, most of our visitors will visit us by public transport, foot, bicycle, or electric vehicles."
"Convenient and Safe: Visitors, customers and personnel all feel right at home."
"Long-term main objective: Continuously taking actions to improve the experience of safety, security, hospitality and service-mindedness."
FOOTPRINT Citycon is committed in becoming carbon neutral by 2030.
This means that by 2030 we will have no direct carbon emissions from our own assets and all our purchased energy will be carbon neutral.
The target is in line with the Paris Agreement.
"It requires us to take energy efficiency measures, increase our own renewable energy production, cooperate with our tenants for energy conservation, and increase the share of carbon neutral energy purchased."
We are committed to Science Based Targets on our way to carbon neutrality.
Our targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in September 2021.
"During 2021, we also devised a carbon neu-trality roadmap to plan our future actions."
"In 2021, 100% of the electricity bought for both our own and our tenants con-sumption was green."
Only two of our centres are heated by fuels.
This fuel usage is reported as direct energy con-sumption.
"During the year, we performed In 2021, 100% of the electricity bought for both our own and our tenants consumption was green."
The data will be published.
"In 2021, we produced 6,858 MWh of onsite renewable energy at our solar, geo-thermal, and hydrothermal powerplants."
"In 2021, we installed solar power plants on the rooftop on three of our centres."
We also kicked off Iso Omenas four-year energy efficiency project that enables a total of 75% savings in purchased heating energy.
"The project is unique in its extent, and it will make Iso Omena exceptionally energy efficient."
Carbon Neutral: Using less energy and producing more of it ourselves Status 2021 Target 2023 Renewable energy production: All assets will produce renewable or recoverable energy for their own use.

All electricity purchased by Citycon is green.
Energy investment: 2% of net rental income will be budgeted for value enhancing energy investments.
We are a committed signatory to World Green Building Associations Net Zero Car-bon Buildings Commitment.
The commitment challenges construction and real estate com-panies and cities to work towards the carbon neutral use of energy at their properties by 2030.
In-depth information on our energy efficiency and carbon footprint can be found in our Key environmental figures on pages 2731.
"In 2021, our centre Iso Omena in Espoo launched a four-year initiative during which its significant amount of the heating system will be renewed."
"As a result, Iso Omena will become exceptionally energy efficient."
"During the first year of the initiative, Iso Omena got a heat pump system that recycles thermal energy that will save up to 2,500 MWh of thermal energy a year."
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS ACCESSIBLE: ENCOURAGING GREEN TRANSPORTATION Citycons goal is to make its centres perfectly integrated with the transport systems of the cities it operates in.
All our centres are already part of the public transport system.
That is also an integral part of both our sustainability strategy and our overall strategy.
All our development projects that are ongoing or being planned are situated in locations that are or will become public transport hubs.
The location is the starting point of the development.
"We want it to be an effortless choice to visit our centres by foot, by bicycle, or by the citys public transport."
This way we wish to promote the sustainable ways of getting around the city.
"All our centres are accessible by bus, 6 centres are directly connected to metro lines, 14 to train lines, and 3 to tram lines."
We have a car-sharing system at 3 of our centres.
"In 2021, 22 of our centres had municipal or private city-bike stations close by."
We wish to promote the sustainable ways of getting around the city.
"We strive to make our centres easy to visit by dedicating parking spaces for low-emission cars, families, and people with disabilities."
"In addition to this, we make sure that all our centres are accessible for people with disabilities."
Accessible: Encouraging Green Transportation Target 2023 Status 2021 Enabling EV uptake: All assets will offer electrical vehicle charging possibility for cars and bikes.
Target partially achieved.

"Bicycling: All assets will promote cy-cling, with different methods tested and the best practices spread across all sites."
Public transport: Public transport options will be proactively developed together with local stakeholders.
Citycon will promote easy access for people with disabilities in all our shopping centres.
Public transport is a key criteria for alldeve-lopment projects.
All our centers are accessible for disabilities and we constantly secure that our assistive devices works properly.
In all development projects disabilities have taken into account on planning phase.
Sweden and Denmark: 64% (+29%) Total: 55% (+10%).
"The next addition to Citycons assets will be Lippulaiva, a unique centre with a state-of-the-art energy concept that promotes local energy production and low-carbon ways of arriving to the centre."
"This includes, for example, 134 charging points for electric vehicles and charging points also for e-bikes."
RIGHT AT HOME TENANT SATISFACTION AND COOPERATION Citycon takes pride in its thriving tenants and cooperating with them is the key to making our centres safe and easy to visit.
Our tenants play an important role in making our centres even more energy efficient and in increasing our already high recycling rates.
"To support our tenants in this area, we offer them advice and hands-on guidance, for example, in terms of energy efficiency when they are remodelling."
"During the second year of the pandemic, our top priority has continued to be the health and security of people working and shopping at our centres."
"This has demanded even more cooperation and flexibility from both, us at Citycon, and our tenants to ensure that our customers can visit our centres safely."
"As the centres have been focusing on deep cleaning of the common areas and providing information on re-strictions and guidelines to customers and tenants, the tenants themselves have taken responsibility for actions regarding their premises and employees."
The cooperation has been enabled by an ongoing dialogue with our tenants.
We have Our top priority has continued to be the health and security of people working and shopping at our centres.
"The cooperation between authorities, tenants, customers, and cen-tres during this challenging time has been smooth and well-functioning."
We also cooperate with our tenants in various community engagement projects that bring the life of the local community into the hearts of our centres.
This lets us and our tenants connect with local people and creates a new meeting place for the people living in the community surrounding our centres.
"Convenient and safe: Visitors, customers and personnel all feel right at home Target 2023 Status 2021 Safety standard for our business & certifying all assets by year-end 2022."
Youth cooperation: All assets will have youth involvement activities in place and Youth-Focused security Guard project spread to all countries by year-end 2022.
During 2021 we made decision to launch internal Citycon Safe Journey standard.
All assets will be certified during 2022.
"Due to COVID, all projects that require physicalpresence has been minimized during 2021."
TheYouth-Focused security guard (NOJA) projecthas been very successful in Finland.

All employees can use one workday per year for voluntary work under the concept Charity day.
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS HEALTH AND SAFETY IN OUR SHOPPING CENTRES As a responsible property owner Citycon con-tinues to drive the development of safe and secure trading venues in the Nordic countries.
We participate in this development actively in Europe as the only Nordic property owner in the European Shopping Places Security Club.
The biggest individual factor influencing health and safety in our centres in 2021 was still COVID-19.
Our goal continues to be ensur-ing safe and secure centres for our tenants and visitors.
Our general focus regarding safety and risks has remained on preventive measures as we are aware that we will be facing novel risks in the future.
Due to the new COVID-19 variant the pandemic placed high demands on our centres as new restriction measures were introduced by the authorities in short notice and the pandemic affected for example the resources of our security provid-er.
"During the year, we developed further our solutions for the situation."
"COVID-19 routines, social distancing, and new solutions are still implemented in all our centres with excellent results."
The challenges have given us a lot of insight for the future and key findings on how we can be even better.
"To make sure we meet the requirements of our tenants now and in the future, we have created an internal safety standard Citycon Safe Journey."
Our goal is that our entire portfolio will be internally certified according to the standard by 2022.
The certification enables us to provide attractive and secure centres where tenants can continue to establish themselves in this time of rapid transitions.
"We continue to develop our safety tech-nology, surveillance routines and, in com-bination with other training initiatives that we have implemented in 2021, strengthen our work and position as a leader in Europe in risk and safety work for trading venues and for our tenants."
"During the year, we held safety training for staff in 11 centres and for tenants in nine centres."
We also arranged fire training in 23 centres and medical and first aid training in seven centres.
In Q4 under 2021 we held two country-based crisis trainings.
"According to the annual health and safety reviews that are carried out in all our assets, there were no reports of incidences of non-compliance with health and safety regulations during 2021."
Health and wellbeing We have created an internal safety standard Citycon Safe Journey.
Currently 93% of our centres are certified through BREEAM In-Use.

"But when given a chance, we wanted to do more."
"In cooperation with the local authorities, we enabled establishing safe and accessible COVID-19 vaccination services at several of our centres."
"Our goal is to make our centres true communi-ty hubs where people, in addition to shopping and services, meet their friends and spend time with their family."
"Even though the society was still affected by the restrictions due to COVID-19, the Citycon centres in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Estonia we were able to bring the community safely together to enjoy, for example, art, sports, music, summer vaca-tion, sustainability, and gardening."
"During the year, we arranged a total of 489 events and community engagement projects."
Our centres also supported the society by offering spaces for local COVID-19 vaccination centres.
At Citycon we strive to engage and co-operate with children and youth in different ways.
Our aim is to have projects where we cooperate with youth in all our centres and their surroundings.
"Our youth cooperation initiatives range from cooperation with schools, vocational schools, and universities to recycling-themed crafts for the smallest ones in the family."
"For example in summer 2021, our centre Kista Galleri in Kista, Sweden, arranged in cooperation with, for example, the church, the City of Stockholm, Muslim Aid, Stockholm City Mission and Fryshuset a summer vacation programme for children."
The two-week programme offered children a chance to practice different sports and to meet new friends.
It was participated by 800 local children.
"We also cooperate with local actors, such as the police and youth work, to discuss and coordinate matters concerning the safety and support of youth visiting our centres."
"In Koskikeskus located in Tampere, Finland, we have a specific cooperation team for youth related matters around the Tampere cen-trum."
"The team has representatives from detached youth work, City of Tampere, and the police, among others, and it met twice in 2021."
"During the year, our centres also hosted numerous donation events to sup-port families in need."
"For example, in Finland we cooperated with Hope, the nationwide charity organisation for families."
"To utilise the empty spaces in our centres, we have offered space for different kinds of art events and cooperated in organising them."
"In 2021, our centres hosted, for exam-ple, pop-up art galleries, events with DJ or live music and even one full scale art festival."
Our aim is that our centres are places where all local people can enjoy art with low threshold and minimum investment.
This promotes our idea that our centres are true meeting places for local communities.
"In September 2021, a group of people from Citycon went outside Kista Galleria and created 11 miniature pothole gardens in the surrounding area."
Pothole gardening is a way to bring a bit more green into the urban environment by utilising existing holes and defects like cracks in the pavement.
It was our way of spreading joy and creating something beautiful with our colleagues.
"READ MORE CASE The science centre INSPIRIA in Sarpsborg, Norway, is known for its interactive exhibitions that engage and inspire young people."
"In 2021, it created a pop-up space with free admission in cooperation with our centre Storbyen."
In Storbyen INSPIRIA has a unique opportunity to connect with the local community.
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS One specific event sparking joy and gaining a lot of positive action in the local community was our resident bees in four of our centres in Finland.
"The centres Koskike-skus, Iso Omena, IsoKristiina, and Myyrmanni have beehives on their roofs."
The honey collected from the hives during the summer is given to the cafes and restaurants in the centres.
Some of the honey is also given out as a prize in a centres own lottery.
We hold our environment in great value and bees are an important part of it.
With our beehives we want to promote biodiversity and the role bees as significant pollinators play in it.
"Citycon does not endorse the activities of any political party or group, but our centres can be used by political parties to host election campaign events, subject to standard leasing terms."
It is part of our co-operation with the community to engage in open dialogue with regional decision makers and officials in our centres neighbourhoods.
"In connection with the zoning and planning of our development projects, our repre-sentatives have participated in meetings with municipal political bodies."
"With the residents and municipal authorities, Citycon has also participated in informal meetings concerning the planning and zoning of our development projects together with mu-nicipal authorities."
With these activities we wanted to increase and facilitate interaction with the local community and openly share information about our development projects with residents.
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS EXCELLENCE IN ACTION: MAKING BEST PRACTICES THE NORM Adopting and using our best practices is a necessity to achieve our sustainability targets.
This requires us to learn from each other and share the best sustainability actions and ideas across our functions and even across country borders in our operating area.
We follow and review our sustainability performance quarterly at group level.
This enables us to evaluate our projects and processes frequently.
Our centres are located in urban areas and one of our focus areas is their accessibility through public and carbon-free transport.
This way we strive to reduce the environ-mental impact of our centres and the indi-rect impacts they have on biodiversity.
None of our centres are located on protected land areas.
Environmental impact assessments are carried out in connection with the ma-jority of our zoning and our major projects.
"When it is not required by law, Citycon evaluates the need for an assessment of its own on a case-by-case basis."
We build the environmental certifications for our centres through BREEAM In-Use method.
The certification processes are carried out by our own staff.
This way our staff gets an opportunity to get to know our centres and has a chance to operate them in the best possible way.
Our in-depth approach to certification plays a significant part in reaching our excellence in action target.
"During 2021, two of our centres were certified for the first time."
The centres were Kristiine Keskus in Estonia and Columbus in Finland (sold to NREP by the end of the year).
"We also recertified Kista Galleria, kersberga, and Stenungstorg in Sweden and IsoKristiina in Finland."
"In 2022, our aim is to recertify all our centres in Norway with BREEAM In-Use V6."
The process was started already in 2021.
"At the end of 2021, 93% of our centres were BREEAM In-Use certified."
"According to our sustainability strategy, all our assets aim to be BREEAM In-Use certified by 2022 and all new development projects will be environmentally certified."
"The Citycon Sustainability Award, launched in 2019, was given in 2021 to Reuse, Environment, and Work Training Center (Ombruk, Milj og Arbeidstreningssenter) in our Kolbotn Torg centre in the Oslo region, Excellence in action: Making best practices the norm Target 2023 Status 2021 Personal targets: A personal targets system will be set in place for sustainability work."
Personal targets for sustainability in use for selected employees.
Getting things done: Sustainability actions at Citycon are carried out through clear responsibilities.
"Lessons learned will be clear-ly listed, results reported, and best practices will be actively taken into use across all assets."
Clear responsibilities and progress in sharingbest practices.
Sustainable Procurement Policy was introduced in 2021.
Environmental certifications: 100% of asset will be BREEAM In-Use certified by year-end 2022 with minimum level of good or higher.
All assets are in line to be certified by 2022.
Environmental certifications: All new development projects will obtain a green building certification with minimum level of BREEAM Excellent or equivalent.
Acknowledging good work: Citycon will present an annual award to a tenant or business partner who has taken excellent sustainability actions during the year.
We launched the annual Citycon Sustainability Awards in 2019.

"The award is given yearly to a tenant, service provider, or cooperation partner that through their actions has excelled in supporting and promoting sustainability in our centres."
"During the year, we continued to utilise our Nordic Technical Manual in tenant investments, maintenance and development projects and energy efficiency projects."
"The manual, launched in 2020, lists the minimum requirements and processes for technical solutions for BMS, HVAC, surfaces, electrical installations, and energy production."
"The aim is to gather best practices into one place and to evaluate what technical solutions are the best for providing energy efficient, low-carbon convenient and safe centres."
The manual will be updated yearly and renewed every three years.

CASE Buying second-hand clothes is a contribution to circular economy and to a sustainable lifestyle.
The increasing popularity of second-hand fashion is present also in Citycons centres.
We collaborate with several tenants that provide sustainable second-hand treasures to consumers.
"In this report, we focus on sustainability topics that have significant impact on Citycon and our stakeholders in 2021."
Integrating sustainability into Citycons op-erations is one of the top values defining our strategy.
"Our ambition is to make sustainable thinking and action the trademarks of our company culture, and to create value for our stakeholders while working for a better tomorrow."
"Our key stakeholders are consumers, tenants, employees, investors and sharehold-ers, analysts, partners, local communities, municipalities, and media, as well as NGOs and industry associations."
"We identified our material topics through workshops, interviews, and surveys that engaged both our internal and external stakeholders."
"The materiality assessment established energy efficiency, renewable energy use, convenience, and safety, low-carbon trans-port, and building management as having the most significance on sustainability in and around our centres."
"Thus, in the future our sustainability strategy and strategic actions are a guideline for all our employees working with these issues."
We have mapped the views of our stake-holders in comparison to the business impor-tance of our different sustainability issues.
We have also assessed our own actions in regard of the local and global impact they can have on sustainability issues.
"Our business operations are supported by group functions, such as sustainability, communications, finance, legal and Human Resource (HR) management activities."
"The heads of sustainability, legal and HR all report to CMC members."
We approach our sustainability man-agement with the purpose of avoiding and mitigating negative environmental impacts caused by our business operations and enhancing the positive social and economic impacts of our operations.
Our goal is to maximise our energy efficiency and produce part of our energy locally.
"On a global scale, we aim at minimising our impact on climate change and contribute to building sustainable cities and communities."
"We carried out the materiality assessment in 2017 and 2018 through interviews with key stakeholder representatives, workshops, and a survey."
"The survey was distributed on social media and centre websites in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia."
The results are still relevant as our fundamental operating environment has remained stable despite the impact of the pandemic.
The results of our materiality assessment are presented and compressed into one picture in our priority matrix.
All items presented in the matrix are considered important.
"The positioning of each item takes the impact, as well as the current internal and external operating environments, into consideration."
Both the sustainability strategy and the priority matrix have been discussed and ap-proved by Citycons Corporate Management Committee.
The GRI indicators presented in this report were selected based on the materiality assessment results.
"In addition to our material aspects, Citycon reports certain other sustainability issues due to their im-portance to external stakeholders, or due to the continuity of sustainability reporting."
The issues that have been identified as material by Citycon are presented in the matrix on the next page.

This way we can investigate where the greatest po-tential for reusing goods lies.
"Our partners in the project are the recycling company Srab, the non-profit second-hand organ-ization Myrorna, Mlndals kommun, the digital peer-to-peer platform Blocket and the clothing company H&M."
Property waste management and sorting in Citycons properties is organised in accordance with country-specific waste legislation and other local regulations.
The recycling rate in our centres remained at the same level as the previous year and was 99%.
WASTE RECYCLING AND WATER MANAGEMENT Part of our sustainability work is ensuring a high recycling rate and efficient waste management in all our centres.
"We provide our tenants online training for recycling and have in majority of our centres a dedicated recycling coordinator to give our tenants hands-on advice on recycling, reusing, and waste management."
"In February 2021, we started operating with new waste management partners in our centres in Finland."
Our co-operation with Remeo and Europress was preceded by a four-month pilot of their SMART-service that enables optimizing the waste disposal system according to its filling.
After a successful pilot the service was introduced to all our centres.
"By August 2021, the new SMART-service had resulted in 5,1 tonnes less CO2 emissions and 145 less times emp-tying the waste containers."
"A reuse project in Sweden, titled System for a reuse industry a transition pathway is carried out together with Swedish Environmental Research Institute IVL."

SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS GREEN FINANCING Citycons key cornerstone in creating long-term value for its investors is sustainability.
"In 2021, Citycon continued following its Green Financing Framework launched in 2019."
The framework reflects practices that support the transition to a sustainable and low-car-bon economy through the development of green assets.
Citycons Green Financing Framework has been developed in alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018.
"Under the Green Fi-nancing Framework, Citycon can issue Green Bonds, Green Commercial Papers, Green Loans, Green Hybrid Bonds or Green Private Placements."
"In March 2021, Citycon issued a EUR 350 million Green Bond."
"As a result of the success-ful issuance, Citycons debt maturity profile was significantly improved, refinancing risk was further reduced and net liquidity was improved as Citycon used the net proceeds to partially pay back the bond maturing 2022 and pay down other short-term debt."
"In June 2021, Citycon issued a EUR 350 million Hybrid Bond."
"The Capital Securities do not have a specified maturity date, but Citycon is entitled to redeem them on any date in three months up to and including the First Reset Date, and subsequently, on each annual interest payment date."
The issuance strengthened the balance sheet and demonstrated Citycons commitment to improving its investment grade credit ratings.
"The net proceeds from the issuances will be allocated to the financing and refinancing of new and existing assets, developments, or projects that meet Citycons Green Financing Framework requirements."
Citycons sustainability and finance teams also classified the companys activities by mapping Citycon groups consolidated IFRS income statement accounts based on wheth-er they are covered by a NACE code included The strong execution and large order books of our green issuances in 2021 demonstrated a continued wide interest in green facilities.
Chief Financial Officer Bret McLeod in the EUs Taxonomy Regulation Delegated Act.
"Based on this classification 97% of City-cons total turnover, 99% of capital expend-iture and 67% of operational expenditure is derived from Taxonomy-eligible activities."
"This report, its content and principles have been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standard."
"Further, Best Practices Recommendations on Sustainability Report-ing (Version 3) published by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) have been applied."
Coverage of the mentioned reporting recommendations is presented on pages 2742.
This report has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards: Core option.
THE SCOPE OF REPORTING AND CALCULATION PRINCIPLES Disclosed environmental performance indicators include Citycons centres and other properties where Citycons ownership is at least 50% and where it has operational control (excluding two properties).
This represents 97% of the leasable area owned by Citycon.
"Environmental data covers the centres and other properties that were owned by Citycon on 31 December 2021, acquired before 30 June 2021, or divested after 30 June 2021."
Data from managed properties is excluded in other Citycons environmental figures.
Development project energy figures are included from the day of completion.
The environmental performance figures are based on actual measurements.
"In other words, estimates are not used."
Citycon annually reports a total portfolio performance even though there are changes in the property portfolio every year.
"These changes are due to acquisitions, sales, and (re)development but these do not significantly differ across years and these limitations are taken into account in the reporting."
Citycon follows the EPRA Best Practices Recommenda-tions Guidelines.
Properties that have been consistently in operation (and not under development) during the previous two full reporting periods are included in the like-for-like portfolio.
Sold properties are excluded from like-for-like comparison.
Figures for Citycon Norway in 2014 have been included in the baseline calculation for Citycons environmental target setting.
"However, data for 2014 has not otherwise been retrospectively corrected."
SUSTAINABILITY AT A GLANCE SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 2021 FOCUS AREAS AND MATERIALITY OTHER CORNERSTONES KEY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS Citycon is responsible for waste manage-ment (97% of the leasable area owned by Citycon).
"Properties in which tenants are responsible for waste management are ex-cluded from reporting, as there is no record available of their waste quantities."
Reported water covers water consumed in common areas and by tenants.
All water comes from municipal waterworks.
ASSURANCE Ernst & Young Oy has provided limited assur-ance for numerical environmental indicators.
The assured GRI Disclosure numbers and EPRA sBPR Performance measures have been marked in the GRI Tables.
The Assur-ance Statement can be found on page 43.
ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY Citycon reports tenants electricity con-sumption in cases where Citycon is responsi-ble for electricity procurement.
"In Citycons centres, tenants have in most cases their own electricity meters and purchase agree-ment, and Citycon has no access to data related to tenant consumption."
"When energy procurement is the tenants responsibility, it has been excluded from reporting."
Energy used for heating and cooling is reported in its entirety.
"In terms of intensity figures, Citycon has limited the reported electricity consumption to common areas where it can have direct influence."
"This includes the elec-tricity used for general lighting, ventilation, and cooling, as well as lifts and escalators and other technical systems within the building."
"Based on case studies, the share of electricity consumption in common areas is between 25% and 70% of total electricity consumption, depending on heating, lighting, and other technical solutions, as well as on the level of controllability."
"CARBON In calculating its carbon footprint, Citycon applies the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustaina-ble Development."
The market-based emission factors for electricity are supplier-specific and the Guarantees of Origin have been taken into account.
"For Estonia, supplier-specific factors were not available."
"Therefore, na-tional residual mix-based emission factors from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) have been used."
"For location-based emissions, the 2020 calculation is based on national production mixes according to AIB."
Location-based emissions factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA) have been used for previous years.
"For all CO2 emission calculations, the source for global warming potential is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5-100 year)."
District heat emission factors for 2021 are based on the most recent yearly emission factor.
"In Finland, emission factors are published by Statistics Finland (latest data 2018)."
"In Sweden, emission factors are based on data from Swedenergy (2019)."
"In Norway, emission factors are based on energy mix data provided by Norsk fjernvarme (2019)."
"In Estonia, emission factors for district heating are based on data provided by heat suppliers."
"In the calculation of greenhouse gas intensity from building energy, the same principles are applied as for energy intensity calculation, with the exception that tenant electricity procured by Citycon is included."
Citycon Scope 3 calculation method has been changed from year 2020 onwards.
New calculation method covers Citycons Scope 3 emissions more comprehensively than previously.
The 2020 emission has been recalculated retrospectively for this report using a new calculation method which takes emissions more broadly into account.
This retrospectively updated 2020 Scope 3 figure has not been assured.
"In 2021, system change caused some changes in emissions calcula-tion data sources, and thus, the figures are not comparable between years 2020-2021."
"The reported recycling rate indicates recy-cled, incinerated, or reused waste fractions as a share of the total waste volume."
Landfill waste is not included in recycled items.
The coverage of energy and associated GHG disclosure is 97% of GLA under operative control.
"The figures are based on measured consumption, estimates are not used."
Kista Gallerias environmental data is included in its entirety.
"When energy procurement is on tenants responsibility, it has been excluded from reporting."
"In terms of intensity figures, Citycon has limited the reported electricity consumption to common areas, where it can directly influence."
"Excluding shopping centres where amount of visitors is not 2021 these were Oasen kontoreiendom, Kongssenteret Vest, Isomyyri and Heikintori."
"The reported consumption includes the headquarters and Citycon Norway office , and Citycon Norway office 2018-2021."
"Other offices, including the Head office are integrated into shopping centres."
"Fuels include oil, natural gas and biofuel."
The intensity is calculated with weather corrected heating consumption.
"MWh Shopping Centres MWh Electricity in common areas District heat Total energy consumption1) 2021 67,750 62,530 139,686 2020 65,111 46,369 120,283 1) Total energy consumption incl."
"Building greenhouse gas intensity, kgCO2e/visitor The coverage of Energy and associated GHG disclosure is 97% of GLA under operative control."
"For Scope 2 emissions, Citycon uses market-based emission factors."
Location based emission factors are used only where clearly stated.
Biogenic Scope 1 emissions from biofuel use in shopping centres are 18 tCO2.
Biogenic scope 3 emissions have not been assessed.
New calculation method cov-ers Citycons Scope 3 emissions more comprehensively than previously.
"In 2021, system change caused some changes in emissions calculation data sources, and thus, the figures are not comparable between years 2020-2021."
The change applies to other reported Scope 3 emission figures.
N/A*-20 55 N/A* 133 5 N/A* 11 6-85 N/A*-80 1) Citycon Scope 3 calculation method has been changed from year 2020 onwards.
The 2020 emission has been recalculated retrospectively for this report using a new calculation method and this updated figure has not been assured.
"In the calculation of greenhouse gas intensity, the numerator corresponds to emissions from electricity in common areas,Tenants electricity supplied by the landlord, district heating and cooling as well as emissions from waste water and waste."
Figures are not comparable between 2020-2021 due to system change.
"In 2021 these were Oasen kontoreiendom, Kongssenteret Vest, Isomyyri and Heikintori."
Kista Galleria is not included in lfl figures 2021-2019.

"Criteria applied by Citycon In preparing the environmental information in Sustainability Accounts 2021, Citycon applied the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, Euro-pean Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) Best Practice Recommendations on Sustain-ability Reporting (3rd Edition) and Citycons own internal reporting principles (Criteria)."
"As a result, the subject matter information may not be suitable for another purpose."
"Citycons responsibilities Citycons management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the environmental information in Sustain-ability Accounts 2021 in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects."
"This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
Ernst & Youngs responsibilities Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained.
"Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report."
"The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.
"Our Independence and Quality Control We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement."
"Ernst & Young also applies International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive sys-tem of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements."
"Description of procedures performed Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement."
"Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance en-gagement been performed."
Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.
"Although we considered the effectiveness of managements internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on inter-nal controls."
Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calcula-tion of data within IT systems.
"A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the environmental information in Sustainability Accounts 2021 and related information, and applying analyt-ical and other appropriate procedures."
