"MANAGEMENT LETTER Dear readers, Our Common Future is the title of the 1987 Brundt-land commission report to the General Assembly of the UN."
"This report was, in many ways, instrumental in driv-ing the ESG movement (among others because the COP meeting roots can be traced back to it)."
It also contains one of the first accepted definitions of sustainable devel-opment: The report states that sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromis-ing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
One could write a long essay (and a lot have) about this definitions meaning and the interpretation.
We would rather focus on one fundamental parameter of any ESG approach that the Brundtland commission framed: the idea that ESG is all about tradeoffs.
"From our perspective, tradeoffs are a key element of any ESG strategy."
Understanding and discussing the tradeoffs that a company made in its operation should be the alpha and omega of any ESG conversation between a company and its shareholders.
"Of course, there are activities that do not imply a tradeoff (or only to a lim-ited extend)."
"However, these remain the exception rather than the norm."
"If tradeoffs are not present, it is likely that the full picture is not presenting itself."
It should not come as a surprise that making ESG deci-sions is about tradeoffs.
"After all, any kind of manage-ment decision is about tradeoffs."
Capital allocation decisions are only about tradeoffs between risk and return.
"However, traditional management decisions are usually much easier to rationalize as the unit of measure for a decisions value is well-defined (usually financial performance), and most of the time understood."
"In the case of ESG, the tradeoff will most of the time involve value scales that are unrelated to each other."
Is it bet-ter to reduce CO2 emissions or improve the occupiers wellness?
Should a building retrofit prioritize mitigation measures on biodiversity or on climate change?
"When introducing home office policies, should the employees wellness be prioritized over the complexity of the remote working system?"
Should it all be the other way around?
"The scales with which we measure each value are not only independent from each other, but they tend to vary from one observer to another."
"The tenant will most likely choose wellness over climate change, while the regulator will look at it the other way around."
Employ-ees will put higher value on their well-being versus the complexity and cost for the company to implement.
Then there are the shareholders who (at least most of them) are likely to put financial returns above all else.
"However, eventually the only scale of value that matters is the one of the decision makers because it is the one that will lead to the tradeoff."
Understanding tradeoffs can offer substantial bene-fits to anyone who reads into a companys ESG strategy.
It can allow easily identifying what really matters from what is marketing and communication.
"Take, for example, a company that decides to issue a green bond."
What is the tradeoff involved?
The com-panys alternative would be to issue a straight bond.
"Therefore, the tradeoff is in the additional complexity and costs of issuing and managing the green bond in exchange for (i) the positive signaling effect provided from the green bond and (ii) (arguably) a couple of basis points of margin reduction."
"Assuming the costs and the margin reduction offset each other, the only tradeoff remaining is the complexity in reporting versus the sig-naling effect."
"This analysis should lead to a conclusion that considering the tradeoff it involves, a green bond is a powerful communication tool, but it is unlikely to affect the actual ESG performance."
One can apply the tradeoff analysis to our new ESG report.
"Doing so, one will probably find that the sev-eral claims we are making involve easy and non-material tradeoffs, such as the one of the green bonds."
"We are, for instance, disclosing a new chapter about our approach to biodiversity."
The recent investment we have started in forestry also does not involve any substantial ESG tradeoffs (but does involve a capital allocation decision) because we are undertaking these investments for a business purpose.
We believe that securing access to what we consider as a strategic scarce resource (wood) is key for the companys future.
"In a similar fashion, we waived rent for some of our retail tenants during the COVID-19 crisis to support their businesses during the time in which they could not operate."
The tradeoff was straight forward.
It was more valuable for us to keep them as a tenant rather than push them into bankruptcy and replace them.
The rent waived was lower than the cost involved in replacing them.
"In both examples above, the decision-making pro-cess did not involve any material tradeoffs outside the field of finance and capital allocation."
These decisions are not different from any other business decision.
They are addressing what we perceive as a specific risk to the company and its business model.
We are preparing the company to operate in an environment that is evolv-ing continuously.
This is not different than adapting our buildings to new forms of work organization and tenant preferences.
"It is part of our duty to ensure the company strives not only today, but also tomorrow."
"Other parts of the report involve different and usually more substantial tradeoffs and should focus the readers attention on the material issues that we believe are rel-evant for the company and the industry, and as such, deserve to be discussed more widely."
They address what we perceive as a more systemic risk and highlight that we are conscious of the impact of our operations on nega-tive externalities.
This tradeoff relates essentially to the companys conscious decision not to participate in the standard new construction of commercial buildings.
It is both simple and substantial.
"We deliberately are not taking part in a profitable corner of our market, which is perfectly legal, and that we know others will occupy, and we are making this decision on the grounds of the systemic risk to which we are unwilling to contribute."
"This tradeoff has a structuring effect on not only our carbon policy, but also the complete business strategy."
This tradeoff analysis is also the bedrock for the Green Dividend.
This specifically addresses the situ-ation where we do not necessarily believe our scale of value should be the only one that drives the tradeoffs.
"Therefore, for the amounts involved in the Green Div-idend proposal, we offer our shareholders alternatives that we believe are worth the tradeoff but seek to bal-ance our value scale with the one of the equity owners of the company in a vote at our AGM."
"The next time we are on the road (virtually and / or physically), and you would like to engage with us on an ESG topic, a good way of starting the conversation would be to ask us (or challenge us) about the tradeoff involved."
Theses conversation usually are the most pro-ductive and insightful of all.
We hope you will enjoy reading this report as much as we enjoyed putting it together.
ALSTRIA IN A NUTSHELL alstria office REIT-AG is Germanys leading office real estate company.
"Our properties are located in the large and liquid German office markets of Hamburg, Dsseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Berlin, where we are represented by local operating offices."
"As a fully inte-grated company oriented toward the long term, alstrias 167employees actively manage our buildings through-out their entire life cycle."
We acquire real estate assets in the large office markets of Germany when they are at the right price and are likely to create financial value over time.
"Our focus is on assets that allow upgrading or flex-ible usage to meet evolving customer demands, and that need to be upgraded to meet new work standards."
"Potential acquisition properties under-go rigorous due diligence, addressing the capital expenditure costs required to up-grade the assets in due time to meet new climate-friendly regulations."
Our local presence in the cities where we operate allows us to work closely with our tenants on all issues.
We pro-vide planning services to customize office spaces and maximize their operational efficiency.
"We also offer added services, such as renewable electricity contracts, smart meters, and coworking options."
"We retrofit existing buildings to create spaces that will appeal to future custom-ers, thus increasing the buildings longev-ity and ultimately their financial value."
"Our approach involves using the exist-ing building superstructure (embedded carbon); reusing building materials when possible; and sensibly selecting durable, low-carbon building products."
Our rede-velopment projects also create new jobs in the local community.
We sell a property when we see the opportunity to deploy capital more effec-tively elsewhere.
"By selling properties in better condition than when we first acquired them, we improve the building environment for our society."

Sustainability governance Departmental roles include: Sustainability aspects especially climate change are inte-gral parts of alstrias governance structure.
The Management Board leads the alstria group by acting in the corporations best interests to create long-term value.
It determines the companys strategic ori-entation and ensures that orientation is implemented.
The Management Board also ensures compliance with all applicable legal provisions and internal regulations as well as sufficient risk management and control.
The Supervisory Board advises and oversees the Management Board in its duties (a two-tier system).
Our sustainability component has been integrated from the top down across all levels of the company since 2009.
The CEO is responsible for all matters concern-ing sustainability.
Directly under the CEO is the head of sustainability and future research.
"At the highest governance level, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Committee of the Supervi-sory Board oversees our sustainability activities to ensure we attain our goals."
"Governance of climate change The Management Board has overall responsibility for climate-related risks and opportunities and to maintain an appropriate risk-management and internal control system, in accordance with Section 91 (1) AktG for Ger-man-listed companies."
"To ensure the proactive identification, monitoring, and assessment of risks, the Management Board has established its internal Risk Committee, which conducts quarterly risk inventories for strategic, compliance, finan-cial, and operational risks."
Senior managers with risk responsibilities related to these four areas identify risks and introduce applicable mitigation plans.
"Furthermore, the results of the quarterly risk assess-ments are presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, which supports the board in review-ing the effectiveness of its risk-management and inter-nal control processes throughout the year."
The company also conducts internal audits that are independent of the companys operations.
The Management Board and Audit Committee receive the results of these internal audits.
The opportunities are evaluated in the context of annual and quarterly budget planning.
This process includes careful analysis of the market and of the opportunities related to the properties held in the portfolio.
"These evaluations include assessments of criteria such as tenant needs, property categories, and regulatory changes."
"The board receives updates on the monitoring of growth initiatives and opportunities, including those related to climate change, during the budget-approval process."
Our head of sustainability and future research carries out the ongoing oversight of climate-related issues and implements the companys sustainability program.
He reports directly to the CEO and regularly updates the board on the performance of our sustainability programs.
"In 2021, the management board remuneration system was adjusted to include ESG specific targets."
"From 2021, 20 % of the STI (short term incentive) performance tar-gets of the management board members relate to ESG aspects."
The presented ESG ratings mainly refer to performance data from 2019 and were obtained in 2020.
They show the results from the rating agencies with which we interacted.
Please note that other rating agencies may analyze our ESG performance without receiving our feedback.
"For more information, including the latest ratings on our 2020 performance data, please see our website at In 2021, we will also receive and comment on ESG ratings from Vigeo Eiris and ISS-oekom."
Our business is interrelated with the interests of various stakeholders.
Understanding their expectations is key to our business success.
Traditional key interests of our stakeholders Create long-term value Promote equal and fair treatment We have established leadership principles to ensure that all our employees are treated fairly and can develop.
We have a compliance system that ensures the effective implementation of our internal regulations.
Provide flexible space We offer services such as our coworking business BEEHIVE a patented digital solution that offers 24-hour access to office space and is specially designed to respond to customers need for a temporary yet sus-tainable office environment.
We only invest in assets that will sustain our growth requirements and deliver long-term returns.
Our operations focus on maintaining the occupancy level in our portfolio and the quality of our revenue stream.
Promote good governance and transparency Our financial and sustainability performance undergoes a yearly external audit.
We comply with most recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.
"We publish information on every building we buy, own, and sell."
We are firmly convinced that an open and reli-able information policy can form a solid basis for trust between our company and our stakeholders.
We have a responsible contracting policy and pay agreed prices within the set time frame.
"With our industry Every year, we participate in various working groups within our industry to promote transparency, innovation, and sustainability in real estate."
"This involvement allows us to anticipate future regulatory changes, identify new trends, and take part in new trend-setting processes."
"Also, we contribute to the ESG Circle of Real Estate (ECORE)."
"Together with many industry peers, we have developed a scoring standard to make sustainability in real estate portfolios transparent, measurable, and comparable."
"In 2020, we invested EUR 75,839 in support of the fol-lowing groups: We are an active member of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA)."
"Our CEO is on EPRAs Advisory Board, is a member of the EPRA Sustainability Committee and chairs EPRAs Accounting and Reporting Committee."
"The EPRA represents the interests of major European property management companies and supports the development and market presence of these com-panies by establishing, among other things, best-prac-tice recommendations for accounting, reporting, and sustainability."
"Furthermore, under the umbrella of the German Prop-erty Federation (ZIA), we participate in working groups for the development of Germanys energy and Climate Action Plan 2050."
The ZIA is a trade association that represents the interests of the entire property sector at the domestic and European levels.
"In addition, we participate in the German Circle of Real Estate (BAMBI)."
"Around 20 asset and property manag-ers join forces in this industry working group to compare strategic metrics, discuss best-practice approaches, cre-ate market standards, and find answers to tomorrows questions together."
We also join DENEFF working groups to develop data- management systems for real estate.
DENEFF is an inde-pendent network that unites frontrunner companies in the energy-efficiency field to represent their collective political interests for effective and ambitious energy- efficiency regulation in Germany.
"In addition to industry associations, we stand with our peers to accelerate the decarbonization of real estate in Europe."
This is one of the reasons why we created a sustainability and innovation think tank with four other leading real estate companies in 2017.
This frame-work fosters joint research projects and other initiatives aimed at strengthening the participating companies inner capacity for innovation and sharing of expertise.
"The companies involved are alstria, COIMA RES, Colo-nial, Gecina, Great Portland Estates, and NSI all lead-ers in sustainability in their respective German, Italian, Spanish, French, British, and Dutch markets."
"Finally, at the cross-sectoral level, we participate in a working group of companies active in the energy sector from all over the world, in which we share best prac-tices and follow the development of energy start-ups and innovative products that could influence the real estate market."
With our tenants We occasionally monitor and measure tenant satisfac-tion.
Our last survey is from early 2020 and was strongly influenced by COVID-19.
"Nevertheless, the results and implications remain rel-evant today, given that most of our key tenants have not changed."
"In 2021, for example, we will conduct additional training on complaint management since we learned, that we can improve our communication."
The survey reached a participation rate of 62 % (47 key ten-ants were approached).
One positive result of the survey is that 86 % of the (surveyed) tenants are satisfied with the work of alstria.
With our employees Employee key interests Companys response We survey our employees for their views on their work environment and the company regularly.
"Our People In a special engagement format in 2019, we addressed their views on alstrias contributions to climate change mitigation."
This led to a tangible action plan.
Its imple-mentation status is summarized below.
PREFACE: CARBON DISCUSSION All our reflections on the climate crisis follow certain considerations.
We have published these thoughts before in articles or reports but summarize them here for completeness.
Climate risks 3.
"Past, present, and future carbon emissions 4."
Creating change and impact Climate risk is the single largest systemic risk to which we are exposed.
Idiosyncratic* environmental risks are well manageable at the portfolio level and for the company itself.
"In addition to being financially sound, our business model aims at reducing the systemic risk caused by climate change."
"We purchase old, inefficient buildings and through their refurbishment, we transition them into modern, effi-cient offices with a substantially lower operational carbon footprint."
"Climate system The climate system is complex, asymmetrical, and non- linear."
"Carbon neutrality is a scientific concept that only applies to the whole system, not (yet) to individual build-ings or companies."
GHG reduction solutions that have a tangible potential to create large-scale impacts in the short to medium term should be preferred.
Avoiding 1 ton of new carbon emissions is not comparable to removing or reducing 1 ton of existing carbon emissions.
Creating a corresponding balancing cycle is scientifically unprovable and physically impossible.
You dont compen-sate; you contribute.
"According to the current state of technology and for the near future, every construction measure, whether it is new construction, renovation, modernization, or maintenance, causes additional emissions."
Constructing buildings has never taken carbon out of the atmosphere there is no such thing as a net-zero or climate-positive building that is rooted in science.
The manufacture of construction materials and the con-struction of a building emit large amounts of CO2.
"The CO2 remains embedded in the building structure until it is deconstructed, and all embodied carbon is lost, or in the very best case, partially recycled into lower-quality construction material (downcycling)."
The circular economy is not about preparing new buildings for deconstruction.
Its about reusing existing buildings as much as possible and extending their lifespan.
The best climate-friendly approach is to refurbish and reuse existing buildings for as long as possible.
A renovation creates only 20 30 % of the embedded CO2 emissions compared to a new building and achieves a comparable energy efficiency.
We can lower additional (embodied) emissions close to zero if we apply low-carbon design principles to refurbish-ment projects.
Electricity and district heating grids will need to decar-bonize steadily in the next 30 years they are the best and fastest methods of retreating from fossil-fuel heating.
Systemwide solutions are key to reaching decarbonization targets.
"Success is founded on an informed and bold vision, convincing and inclusive communication, open and accessible data, and agile and collaborative progress."
"To understand how these considerations influence our climate-related risk assessment as well as our GHG-re-duction strategy, please see The impacts of climate change on our Business and the Our Buildings sections, respectively."
"OVERVIEW: THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR BUSINESS Climate change impacts the physical, market and sys-temic conditions of our business."
"In general, we are well positioned to deal with exist-ing and potential physical and market related changes."
Our assets are in areas with (on a global scale) relatively limited climate sensitivity.
"In most cases, the changes in market regulation and tenant demand that will be caused by the transition to a low carbon society are known and predictable."
The adaptation and innovation need of our assets and services fits naturally in the modernization cycle of alstrias portfolio.
"However, our business is not immune to the systemic risks created by climate change."
The following paragraphs detail our views on climate change related impacts on our business and give an over-view on our response strategies.
"Physical Market Systemic Physical impacts In general, alstrias property portfolio is subject to extreme weather events, such as flooding, storms, and hail, which may weaken building structures and threaten tenants safety."
"Such phenomena will intensify in the coming years, from our perspective."
"To determine our portfolios exposure to future weather patterns and natural hazards, we recently con-ducted an analysis using climate and hazard databases provided by MunichRe and SwissRe."
"The analysis showed that our current portfolio is not highly exposed to physical risks, given that our assets are located in Germany."
"The central response strategies to physical impacts are as follows: Regularly update physical climate-risk assessments to determine which buildings must be upgraded accordingly, As long as available securing the risk through insur-ance contracts covering the portfolio from the loss of rent due to fire, storms, hail, or any act of God, with a total insured value at least as high as our assets balance sheet value."
"Market impacts After the Paris Agreement, Germany adopted national climate targets intended to accelerate the transition from a carbon-based economy to a carbon-lite economy."
They also impose stringent obligations for the building sec-tor to meet by 2050.
These targets should accelerate the annual rate of building renovations.
"Failing to meet new climate regulations may decrease the attractiveness of our assets, which may, in turn, lower or nullify their rental potential and ultimately decrease the companys revenues and value."
"Failing to respond to this potential demand would make assets unattractive, implying a subsequent decline in their rental potential."
The transition from a carbon-based economy to a car-bon-lite economy will be complex and challenging.
Only a small portion of the build environment is currently prepared for such a transition.
Managing the current real estate stock throughout this transition will require not only a substantial amount of capital but also substantial operating skills.
"Although neither of these is in short supply, only a few real estate players combine both skills under one roof."
We believe we are one of them.
Ongoing monitoring and compliance with applicable laws and standards.
Compliance and Ethical Conduct Participate in industry bodies to monitor emerging legislation early on and analyze customer preferences continuously.
"Stakeholder Engagement Integrate physical, regulatory, and demand-related impacts in all central decision-making and planning processes (incl."
"OPEX and CAPEX) along our business cycle (buy, manage, redevelop, and sell), to reduce the carbon footprint of our building portfolio."
"Our Buildings and Our office design Putting the development of existing assets at the core of the business model, instead of ground-up develop-ments."
We are convinced that regulators will increas-ingly incentivize this approach.
"Systemic impacts Our business is directly impacted by the economys overall health, for which it is a good proxy."
Climate change effects do not need to be direct to become material to us.
"Our assets can become stranded due to climate changes happening thousands of kilometers away, because they can affect our tenants economic health."
"These systemic risks include but are not lim-ited to climate refugees, political instability, and global supply chain disruptions, which are likely to impact us sooner and more frequently than any of the direct risks described above."
"To address the systemic risks of climate change for alstrias business within the frame of our fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we engage in the following: Raise environmental standards in the real estate industry and beyond by sharing our learning from our decarbonization measures and innovation projects."
"Stakeholder Engagement and Our Buildings Push for more recognition among regulators (leading to financial incentives) that retrofitting existing buildings is more climate friendly then creating new buildings, even if the new buildings are labeled energy efficient Stakeholder Engagement and Our Buildings Innovate through carbon-accounting standards to be more transparent about alstrias contribution to and risks from climate change in financial terms."
Innovating in carbon accounting RECAP Identify and enable shareholder investment in alstria projects that do not improve alstrias risk / return profile but maybe improve that of certain shareholders port-folios by reducing the systemic climate risk to the real estate industry and beyond.
It takes a dynamic view of our contributions to climate change.
It does not solely focus on annual flows but considers the cumulative impacts (both positive and negative) that we will have over time.
"Finally, it frames the carbon conversation as an account-ing framework, which is familiar to investors, using a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement."
"In addition, the information enriches our internal deci-sion-making processes, such as regarding the portfolio strategy."
The carbon accounting report is based on a publicly available framework that we developed and what we call RECAP Real Estate Carbon-Accounting Principles.
"Innovating in carbon accounting RECAP For FY 2020, for the first time, we have produced a bal-ance sheet and a profit and loss statement that, in our view, expresses how alstrias current buildings portfolio contributes to climate change."
"In other words, these are the negative environmental impacts of our business for which alstria has not paid for (yet)."
The calculation is based on the EU ETS pricing on carbon.
It deals with the embedded GHG emissions and the current and future operational GHG emissions of alstrias portfolio in 2020 (alstrias full carbon valuation).
"We believe investors will be especially interested in this information because: On the one hand, it is a good proxy for future regula-tory costs and compliance efforts since regulators likely will internalize (parts of) these external effects to the market, On the other hand, it shows how alstria contributes to the systemic risks caused by climate change, which are tangible portfolio risks for many investors given the global and diversified structure of their securities."
"We assume that, given the significant challenges on the way to a coherent and appropriate regulatory framework for global climate change (in the form of more realistic carbon pricing), some investors are looking proactively for ways to reduce their portfolio risks caused by cli-mate change."
"In other words, this is the value of the carbon that would need to be spent to rebuild a portfolio of similar size as the one we cur-rently own."
"If carbon were a real estate asset, it would be our 41st largest asset (out of110)."
"Finally, if we had from tomorrow onward to pay for every ton of CO linked to the future operational car-bon of our 2020 portfolio, the additional liability would be estimated at about EUR 28 million (as of Decem-ber31, 2020)."
"In other words, this is total financial exposure that the company would face if carbon had a value."
"In a sense, this amount reflects an overstatement of our IFRS funds from operations (FFO) metric, which is a key measurement of our operating performance and the basis for our dividend."
"Thus, ones could say that these unpaid carbon expenses represent a permanent windfall profit realized by the company in its IFRS accounts."
Should it be paid out as dividend?
Should it be spent on financially non-viable projects that would reduce the carbon impact?
We do not believe that this decision lies solely with the companys management but that it should be taken jointly with the companys shareholders based on man-agement proposals.
"The fair market value of carbon that we used is equal to the daily closing price of the ECX EUA Futures Continuous Contract, trading on ICE."
All numbers are unaudited.
Financing climate protection Green Dividend Climate change poses a significant challenge to the global economy and the ways modern economics works.
"In the absence of more-decisive government intervention (in the form of carbon pricing that is more realistic), we see a need for coordinated action to foster additional coop-erative behavior among the various economic agents involved in the climate transition."
"Thus, in May 2021 at the Annual General Meeting, the company asked its shareholders for the second time whether they would approve spending corporate assets on environmental projects that would not meet the com-panys riskreturn expectations but instead would con-tribute to addressing the systemic risk of climate change."
Innovating in carbon accounting RECAP How does it work?
The company identifies projects with a positive envi-ronmental impact that would not be financed based on financial criteria only.
A Euro amount needed to finance these projects is proposed to the Annual General Meeting as Green Dividend.
Shareholders are asked to cast their vote for the payout or against the payout (majority rule apply).
The proposed projects are implemented by the com-pany and the proposed Euro amount will be deducted from next years dividend.
"Green Dividend projects in 2021 Project 1: Install up to 900 kW peak of solar panels on alstrias buildings Solar energy is a natural fit with office properties, which usually operate during the daytime when solar energy is available but are empty at night when it is not."
"In addition, rooftops offer a natural home to solar energy generation."
"Moreover, producing energy at or close to the point of consumption saves a substantial amount of energy because it reduces the loss between the energy produced (primary energy) the energy consumed (consumption energy)."
"As such, we think solar panels need to become a major tool in the decarbonization toolbox of office buildings."
"However, according to German law, an office land-lord cannot efficiently resell the energy produced by the building to the actual users of the building, who are under no obligation to buy it."
This is too low to justify the initial investment from a purely financial perspective.
"Project 2: Fund up to EUR 750 k of early research and concept validation for carbon removal projects Carbon removal is the action of physically removing a defined amount of CO2 from the atmosphere, therefore netting an identical emission elsewhere."
The real estate industry will need to identify a viable carbon dioxide removal technology that would allow the removal of a vast amount of dispersed CO2 emissions in an efficient way.
A promising field of research that real estate could use is related to CO2 mineralization.
One of these processes takes place in the concrete of our assets (the so-called carbonation process).
Similar processes can take place in other minerals and provide for extensive fields of research for CO2 removal technology.
We have identified project Vesta as a first candidate to benefit from a potential contribution.
Project Vesta is a science-based project to test a process aimed at accel-erating the carbonation process of a rock called olivine and removing CO2 on a large scale from the atmosphere in the process.
"For details, see the section titled Embodied GHG emissions in 2020."
DECARBONIZING OUR BUILDING PORTFOLIO Germany aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 relative to 1990 emission levels.
"With the building sector accounting for around one-third of Germanys GHG emissions, our sector can be the catalyst for such change."
"On the following pages, we first introduce our GHG emission categories as well as our influence and general action areas to reduce them."
"Afterward, we report on the concrete GHG performance and the related actions of alstria in 2020."
Introduction The overview graphic below first illustrates the overall GHG emission categories that occur at alstrias buildings (green clouds).
"While these are largely considered as Scope 3 emissions and usually disregarded as emitted by someone else in the value chain, they represent the lions share of our business impact on climate change."
"We therefore feel it is our duty to take them into account and, if possible, to reduce them."
"On the one hand, we deal with embodied emissions that relate to building materials and building processes (also called upstream emission)."
"On the other hand, our buildings create operational emissions from heating and electricity use (also called downstream emis-sion)."
"The reduction potential, however, is sometimes mainly determined by grid decarbonization or modernization (displayed with the white wedge), which means that alstria has only an indirect influence."
Our influence on embodied GHG emissions The single-largest share of GHG emissions that will occur during the lifecycle of a typical new office building is linked to the manufacturing of materials and the initial construction phase.
"Together with the emissions from maintenance and replacement activities throughout the years, as well as the emissions from end-of-life disposal / demolition of the building, they constitute the so called embodied GHG emissions of the building."
"We think the most sustainable building is the one that is never built, and the second-most sustainable building is the one that already exists and continues to be used."
"Unfortunately, we are perceiving that this is not a shared understanding in the real estate community and beyond."
Even the comprehensive European Union taxonomy for sustainable activities chases carbon neutrality by focus-ing essentially on buildings operational emissions and neglecting embodied emissions from construction.
The main reason which we hear why embodied car-bon is not sufficiently considered (from our perspective) is that it is difficult to measure.
"We agree that it is com-plex to measure, but we believe that this does not make it less real or important."
Recent scientific studies indicate that the ratio between embodied and operational car-bon is shifting increasingly towards embodied emissions being the larger part over the whole life cyle.
"In other words, the carbon emitted by the cement, and steel used during the construction represent the largest share of the overall lifetime emission of new buildings."
"These studies show that, given the current state of technology, a new building cannot be climate neutral."
Relying on new con-struction will not solve the real estate carbon puzzle.
"New building simplied model calculation Refurbish and reuse Demolition Years 10 20 30 40 50 One building life cycle On the contrary, from our perspective, new construction is an integral part of the problem."
"Larger, more imme-diate emissions from new construction cannot justify potentially lower emissions from operations in the future."
"Hence, an existing building fabric must be preserved and reused for as long as possible."
"Thereby, large carbon emissions can immediately be avoided."
"Looking back at our portfolio, a typical alstria building emits about 20 40 kgCO2e/m per year."
Our industry holds a key responsibility for embodied emis-sions as we (the real estate investment community) are the ultimate decision-makers and investors when it comes to new buildings.
"At alstria, we have adopted the policy of not participating in projects involving the construction of new greenfield commercial developments."
"Instead, we focus our activity on refurbishing existing assets."
"Through this approach, we can operate the company profitably and at the same time (in order of potential impact): contribute to avoiding the GHG intensive demolition of old buildings and / or the construction of new (office) buildings by others; reduce the embedded carbon added to the buildings backpack during refurbishment by demanding low-car-bon materials**** from our building service providers wherever they are suitable and economical; decrease our buildings future needs for modernization, maintenance, and repair (additional embodied carbon) by choosing durable and simple designs."
Our influence on operational GHG emissions The second-largest source of GHG emissions from our buildings is the operational energy consumption.
"To put it in numbers: About 88 % of the operational energy is consumed in the tenant areas (scope 3), and about 12 % (scope 2) is consumed in the common areas / landlords shared services."
"In 2020, about 1/3 of the operational energy was con-sumed in fossil fuel (essentially natural gas) heating, 1/3in district heating, and about 1/3 for electricity."
"How-ever, about /5 of the GHG emissions came from fuel heating, 1/5 from district heating, and /5 from electricity consumption."
The GHG emissions from electricity and district heating are part of energy grids that will decarbonize heavily in Germany till 2045.
"However, fuel heating will depend strongly on natural gas in the foreseeable future."
"So far, biogas is not economical for the heating of our buildings, and we think direct heating with green hydrogen will not be available until 2040."
From a climate perspective the need and value added of decarbonizing natural gas heating is driven by the speed at which electricity and district heating grids will decarbonize.
"As of today, in most cases, natural gas remains the most climate friendly location-based approach."
"This will change overtime, depending on the grid decarbonization speed."
Emissions from heating The influence we have to reduce these emissions is rel-atively limited.
"Although we select the heating system and submeter the consumption for tenant areas in multi-tenant buildings (which constitute the biggest part of our portfolio), the net reduction effects / possibilities depend heavily on the status of the grid infrastructure / decarbonization."
"Regarding the continued use of conventional heat-ing plants, it is generally possible to compensate for the necessary fuels, what we currently do to a certain extent (see EPRA data table in the Appendix)."
"However, carbon offsetting is not the path we want to pursue long term."
The GHG reduction effect of grid conversion depends strongly on the related grid decarbonisation.
"Most of our regional and municipal district heating suppliers have announced decarbonization strategies that include the following: increasing the share of renewables in district heating, and phasing out coal by 2030 at the latest; including industrial waste heat and waste incineration in the energy mix; developing thermal energy aquifer stor-age to allow for summer and winter heat exchange; and building power-to-heat and hydrogen plants to allow surplus solar and wind power for heat."
The influence we have to reduce these emissions is rela-tively low.
"In German office buildings, the by-far-larger share of electricity is obtained through energy contracts that tenants close directly with energy suppliers for their spe-cific tenant areas."
"Moreover, data privacy law, makes it increasingly difficult for us to acquire knowledge of our tenant consumption, which is only provided to us on a voluntary basis."
"In addition, a national building data base is still not in place in Germany."
The impact of energy flexibility measures depends strongly on the further decarbonization of the elec-tricity grids in Germany.
"With regard to our opportuni-ties to install on-site photovoltaic systems, we depend strongly on the further evolution of the market econom-ics, including the regulatory framework, the installation cost, and tenant demand / willingness to pay."
"Embodied GHG emissions in 2020 Performance Based on findings from LETI, we have estimated our embodied GHG emissions."
"Based on our total lettable area in 2020, we thus assume that alstria carries about 1,400,000 tCO2e in its portfolio."
"Based on an internal calculation using findings from LETI, we estimate about 35,000 tCO2e of additional embodied carbon from our refurbishment activities in 2020 (total area under construction is about 85,000 m)."
"However, we also estimate that the construction of the same let-table area through new buildings would have emitted about 89,000 tCO2e (including the demolition of old buildings)."
"As such retrofitting the assets rather then demolishing them and rebuilding new corresponds to avoided emissions totaling about 54,000 tCO2e."
"Assuming that our refurbishment activities usually take about three years, we estimate about 11,500 tCO2e (about 400 kgCO2e/m) of additional embodied carbon for 2020."
"However, we also estimate about 18,000 tCO2e of emis-sions (about 600 kgCO2e/m) of avoided embodied car-bon for the year of 2020."
The later savings are equivalent to the entire operation-al emissions of a typical alstria building (20 40 kgCO2e/ m per year) during a period of about 15 30 years.
"In addition, we assume, based on past experience and design assumptions, that these refurbishment projects after completion will lead to an average annual opera-tional carbon savings of at least 30 % (which corresponds to about 1,000 tCO2e) due to energy-efficiency gains."
The following table summarizes our calculation.
We are constantly revising and challenging our methodology and assumptions by following the academic discussion.

"Key reduction measures In 2020, we introduced a series of low-carbon design principles providing our developers and service providers with a framework for balancing and testing the different components of a low-carbon design."
The recommenda-tions reflect the EUs current climate strategy.
Reducing Embedded Carbon Reducing Operational Carbon 1.
Continue to use the building stock: Continue to use the existing building fabric and build only components that are necessary.
"Build low carbon: Minimize the use of new concrete and steel, and instead, use low-carbon products that are durable."
"Whenever possible, electrify buildings: Electrify buildings and thereby support the decarbonization of the grid."
"Grid-compatible buildings, although they are lower in initial carbon efficiency, will perform with higher energy flexibility in the future."
Low-tech is the future: Incorporate high-tech tech-nology only when it yields a substantially superior benefit compared with a low-tech alternative.
Building automa-tions usually require substantial resources for produc-tion and operation and hence accelerate the pace of the obsolescence of the building in which they are installed.
"First, reduce energy demand: Optimize the building envelope, and focus on passive solutions."
"For example, an airtight faade with mass behaving as a temperature buf-fer can reduce heating demands."
"In addition, challenge design-driven technical equipment, and instead, favour equipment that offers more comfort and flexibility."
"Then, increase efficiency: Check and configure the settings of central building services to realize efficiency gains at little cost."
"Implementing our low-carbon design principles As the following table shows, we are making good prog-ress with implementing our low-carbon design principles across our development program."
"In 2020, the total area under construction was about 86,700 m (after develop-ment), representing about 6 % of our total portfolio area."
"We have designed our pipeline with flexibility, which enables us to slow down our commitments while still progressing as we deal with the impact of COVID-19."
"As we refurbish properties only within our own port-folio, we can design and plan the project while the asset is still yielding."
"We determine the scope and depth of the refurbishment by taking into consideration the need to provide the asset with a new life that will meet tenants demands, improve the overall efficiency, and yield posi-tive returns."
We do not strive to maximize but rather to optimize and to achieve a balanced project.

"Operational GHG emissions in 2020 Performance To analyze the operational GHG emission performance of our portfolio in use we apply several methods: extrapolation and benchmarking with the reduction pathways provided by the scientific CRREM consortium, extrapolation and benchmarking with the reduc-tion pathways provided by the Science Based Target Initiative, time series comparison of the collected consumption data."
We track our annual emissions and energy use per letta-ble area with the CRREM Decarbonization Target Tool.
Six well-known research institutions from various Euro-pean countries developed and further revised it based on EU funding.
The Laudes Foundation funded the proj-ect from 2021 onward.
We have been contributing to the devel-opment of the methodology since 2017.
"In 2018 and 2019, we supported the piloting as a corporate partner with consumption data, related background information, and feedback."
"Decarbonisation pathway kgCO2e/m/yr 100 Energy reduction pathway kWh/m/yr 250 alstrias operational energy intensity1) about 130 kWh/m alstrias operational GHG intensity2) about 40 kgCO2e/m 200 150 100 50 2020 2030 2040 0 2050 80 60 40 20 0 1) Extrapolation for whole portfolio area based on about 60 % of electricity and 85 % of heating consumption data; location-based calculation using emissions factors from CRREM for electricity in Germany, from our local suppliers for district heating, and from the German federal environmental agency for fuel (natural gas)."

"The distinction between types of property use is particularly relevant for real estate owners, such as alstria, whose portfolio is almost entirely offices."
"Important pillars of our business approach, which we summarized in our low carbon design principles, are the foundation of the benchmarking result: focusing on robust low-tech buildings (to reduce active and energy-intensive building components) with good access to public transport, switching to district heating and electric heat pumps whenever possible, and selecting buildings according to their grid compatibility, constantly improving the structural energy efficiency (30 %+) of the building portfolio with an in-house refur-bishment department."
"With this approach, our portfolio does better than the market average."
"Responding to the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) We also benchmark our performance against the decar-bonization pathway (expectations) of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which is a partnership among the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)."
"Compared with CRREM, the SBTi does not distinguish between country and building use types."
"In addition, it does not provide kWh reduction pathways."
"Through the SBTi, alstria asserted that the total oper-ational GHG emissions of its buildings portfolio would be reduced by at least 30 % until 2030 from a base year of 2018."
This includes a continued sourcing of 100 % renewable energy in the landlords shared services / com-mon areas in multi-tenant buildings and in alstria offices.
"Between 2018 and 2020, the absolute operational GHG emissions of our portfolio (extrapolated to full coverage) dropped from about 65,000 tCO2e to about 40,000 tCO2e (location based) respectively from about 50,000 tCO2e to about 30,000 tCO2e (market based)."
"Collected consumption data Out of our 2020 portfolio of 109 buildings, we were able to cover the operational emissions of 99 properties (30single-tenant properties and 69 multi-tenant proper-ties) in the year under review."
"Nine buildings were being refurbished, and one was acquired in 2020."
The data coverage of the energy consumption that alstria has procured is relatively high at 98 % to 100 %.
"The acquisition of the energy consumption data that tenants have procured, especially for single-let proper-ties, is a common problem that German landlords face."
Due to data privacy laws no tenant is obliged to share its consumption data and we must rely entirely on the cooperation and the monitoring systems of our tenants.
"Nevertheless, we were able to collect about 65 % of the tenant heating and about 63 % of the tenant electric-ity consumption in 2020, which led to the values shown in the graphic on the right side."
The reduc-tions are mainly explained by COVID-19.
"Key reduction measures Looking at the key action areas to reduce heating-and electricity-related emissions introduced above, alstria contributed as follows in FY 2020: Switching fossil fuel heating to district heating and electric heat pumps Germany introduced carbon taxing for fuel heating (oil and natural gas) in 2021."
"Our new framework procure-ment contract, which we plan to close in 2021, will reflect this, as we plan to cancel all carbon compensa-tion for natural gas starting in 2022."
We are exploring procurement methods that will allow for more natural gas from biogas plants and hydrogen in the future.
"In collaboration with our environmental service pro-vider, Buhck Group, we are conducting a pilot project in 2021 / 2022 to supply buildings in our portfolio with excess heat from biogas plants and waste incineration."
What is unique in this project is that heat from a regional biogas plant that cannot be fed into a local district heat- ing grid is stored in containers and then transported directly to our properties.
"In this way, excess energy in the biogas plant that would have otherwise been lost can be used to cover buildings heating demands by replacing previously used fossil-fuel heating."
"Renewable energy procurement In 2019, we signed a new framework contract on 100 % renewable energy sourcing for 2020 2021 for the com-mon areas (landlords shared services) in multi-tenant buildings and in our offices."
It comprises extended requirements on renewables that include the physical coupling of electricity generation and 20 % of energy from plants younger than three years.
"We further advised our tenants to join our renewable energy procurement contract ( de), thus allowing them to reduce their own emissions."
"This approach benefits both parties: tenants can access the cheaper energy that alstria negotiates, and alstria can increase its buying power, thereby achieving better pric-ing for the utility costs it bears."
"Individual tenants may contract directly with the utility company (at alstrias discretion), which will allow them to maintain the clean energy contract even in the case of alstrias disposal of the asset."
Additional participation in the framework contract contributed to about 5 % reduction of the total tenant electricity emissions in 2020.
"Enabling Energy Flexibility To take advantage of governmental incentives promot-ing electric vehicles (EV), we have begun pilot projects involving installing electric vehicle (EV) charging solu-tions across our portfolio in collaboration with various providers."
This is enabling us to prepare for the increased demand in e-mobility expected from customers in the next few years.
"To provide our buildings with the maxi-mum capacity of charging stations, we are now installing dynamic load management systems."
Such systems will allow us to expand our buildings energy flexibility by balancing the buildings electricity demands with their EVs and prepare for the next step which involves energy generation and storage.
"In the area of renewable energy generation, we began to install solar panels on our buildings in 2021."
"Following the approval of the Green Dividend project, we plan to install about 900 kWp of solar panels on the roofs of our buildings till the end of 2022."
"In addition, in 2021, we plan to install 150 kWp of solar panels in refurbished assets."
"In 2020, the solar capacity installed on two build-ings in our portfolio was at 110 kWp."
"The produced energy of around 100,000 kWh was fed into the grid."
Reducing demand through smart metering and energy management The total energy consumption of our portfolio relies on strong collaboration with our tenants and on our under-standing of the consumption behavior in our buildings.
We have thus started in 2016 to replace conventional electricity meters with smart meters to monitor energy consumption for landlord shared services in real time.
Since 2020 our whole portfolio is equipped with electric smart meters.
"In 2021, we will start using load man-agement systems in buildings with heavy EV charging, which will enable us to track whole building electricity consumption in real time."
We will use these data to uncover inefficiencies in the operation of our buildings.
The Hamburg-based startup company Vilisto supplies alstria with smart thermostats that use occupancy detec-tors to regulate the room temperatures of our BEEHIVE spaces and corporate offices.
"For its vision to help cus-tomers to save energy and CO2 emissions, Vilisto has been awarded the 2020 German Innovation Prize for Climate and Environment."
"We aspire to use our corporate offices as a platform for testing new technologies, and we look forward to drawing results that will eventually impact other areas in our portfolio as we pursue our goal of reducing energy consumption."
We therefore run an energy management system yearly according to ISO to identify appro-priate energy-efficiency measures.
MIND THE CARBON GAP Climate-friendly tenant decisions1): How many years would it take to achieve the same amount of carbon savings as deciding to rent office space in a refurbished building instead of a new one?
We believe that one of the best-climate friendly decisions a tenant can make is to rent office space in a refurbished instead of a new building.
"To support our thinking, we have created the following small model calculation, which is based on simplified but solid assumptions."
"The impact of choosing office space in a refurbished building is huge and corresponds to avoiding immedi-ately around 15,000 kgCO2e* per workplace."
"To put this into perspective, a person would need to stop using his or her car for about 15 years or to cut all personal flights for about 30 years or to live on a pure vegetarian diet for about 30 years to achieve the same carbon footprint reduction."
Other decisions in an office space can also help ten-ants to reduce the carbon footprint of each employee/ workplace.
"In the following chart**, we have listed them according to the question: how many years it would take to reach the same amount of carbon saving as our best-case solution."
This is not to say that you should do one thing or another to compensate.
Rather we want to show the wealth of possibilities and put them in perspec-tive with our best-case solution of refurbish and reuse existing buildings.
We think one should implement as many of these measures as possible.
"Rent office space in a refurbished Use electricity from renewable Rent in an energy efficient building sources building Now +40 years + 60 years Office without mechanical ventilation and cooling Use cloud computing / cut server electricity by half + 150 years + 200 years Use efficient lighting Recycle office waste + 300 years + 1,000 years simplified model calculation 15,000 kgCO2e per workplace 350 kgCO2e per workplace 220 kgCO2e per workplace 90 kgCO2e per workplace 70 kgCO2e per workplace and year and year and year and year 50 kgCO2e per workplace and year 10 kgCO2e per workplace and year 1) Calculation of the respective savings potential based on findings from alstrias ISO energy management system."
"A typical office workplace has 25 m, and reusing and refurbishing an existing building instead of a new construction helps to avoid around 600 kgCO2e/m (25 m/wp 600 kgCO2e/m = 15,000 kgCO2e/wp)."
Details on how we calculate the avoided emissions are available in the section Our GHG emissions and key actions in 2020 / Embodied GHG emissions.
"REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION Tenant areas No water stress generally exists in Germany, where our business operations take place."
"For our part, whenever we refurbish one of our buildings, we try to include a rainwater col-lection or stormwater retention system, as well as grey-water systems for toilets or sprinklers."
We also regularly run controls on the sewer pipes across our portfolio to detect significant liquid spills.
Water in our portfolio is procured exclusively from local authorities either through our tenants or through us and submetered directly to them.
"The use of water in our buildings is for tea kitchens, toilets, and green areas."
"In 2020, our portfolios water consumption was 241,329 m."
"We use water in our corporate offices responsibly and have water-saving devices installed in tea kitchens, toi-lets, and green areas."
"This is mainly due to the additional amenities provided in our head office (fitness and shower facilities, as well as chilled and hot drinking water dis-pensers in all break rooms)."
"In 2020, this system covered 69 of 99 buildings."
Our goal is to eventually include all buildings from our portfolio in this system and to improve our recycling rate.
"In 2020, we printed approximately 13 sheets of paper per employee per working day."
The paper used is FSC certified.
We also regularly inform our employees about our waste separation process.
"Construction waste alstrias central policy toward the minimization of construction and demolition waste in our refurbish-ment / development projects is alstrias low-carbon design principles framework, which we published in 2020, and which we apply to all of our refurbish-ment / development projects."
"It emphasizes the impor-tance of reduce and reuse, for example, by demanding to continue using the building stock as much as possible (Principle 1) or to minimize the use of new concrete and steel in favor of products that are durable, natural, and renewable, such as wood (Principle 2)."
"This is also a cen-tral pillar of our overall sustainability approach, which recognizes the importance of embedded environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective."
"We dont buy, sell, or use building material directly; instead, we buy the assembled service."
"The separa-tion, disposal, and recycling (waste management plan) of construction and demolition waste is part of the service (and fixed price) that our suppliers deliver for us."
This means that waste management plans and waste sepa-ration are available for all our projects.
We expect that our suppliers / service providers follow these regulations.
This is specifically expressed in our standard building service contract.
"Our contracts for building service providers create incentives for recovering and recycling building materials, as they are based on a fixed price for the full service, including the removal of building waste."
We do not spe-cifically price / negotiate the waste removal.
"This means, for example, if the provider of a demolition task finds ways of selling the construction waste to a road con-struction project instead of taking it to a landfill (which costs money), he can keep the revenue."
Our building approach to retrofitting rather than demolishing generates much less waste and uses less energy.
Specialized waste disposal companies collect and treat waste from our construction activities according to German standards (to our knowledge).
"In 2020, approx."
"Green roofs on an alstria building in Stuttgart PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY In general, state regulations in Germany address a large number of biodiversity-related aspects."
"For example, as required by law, in 2020, we conducted an environmen-tal assessment for all of our redevelopment projects."
"In addition, because our portfolio mainly consists of office buildings in major German cities, biodiversity is usually only slightly affected."
Our main contribution to biodiversity protection lies in the fact that alstria never takes part in greenfield developments for commercial properties.
"However, we understand that we can positively con-tribute to biodiversity and thus started to analyze our portfolio regarding certain relevant topics."
"In 2021, we bought our first forest in the state of Bran-denburg in Germany."
"Our main objective through forest acquisition is to secure long-term access to timber and other wood construction materials, which are critical to our ability to deliver on our business."
"As a side effect, it is an important contribution to protecting carbon sinks and biodiversity, as we aim to manage the forest in a sustainable way."
We are targeting improving the resil-ience of the forest by introducing more diversity in the tree mix (including increasing native species) and in the harvesting approach.
The expertise and commitment of our employees drives our business success.
"At alstria, our mission is to offer employees an attractive, stable, and opportunity-rich working environment that enables high-quality perfor-mance."
"In this way, we can help ensure that our talented people stay onboard for the long term."
HR agenda Our Human Resources (HR) team is committed to guid-ing our employees in their career paths and enhancing their well-being.
The teams central goal is to ensure the company recruits the right talents and that these talents are nurtured and can thrive within the company.
"This requires the following: First, aligning our employer branding to the market and attracting talented professionals that match the companys culture."
"Second, ensuring a management culture that contin-ually develops our employees and promotes the right people."
"Finally, retaining good managers and employees and promoting their commitment and enthusiasm for the company."
"Our approach starts with transparent recruiting, an ori-entation program for new employees, continuous staff support and consulting, training, building of strong man-agerial skills, regular feedback sessions, annual perfor-mance appraisals and an annual employee survey."
The year 2020 was heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
"To protect our employees and to ensure that all operations could run as good as possible we intro-duced the following measures: Continuous and up-to-date communication on new requirements and suspected cases mainly via online channels, Dedicated escalation processes for suspected or pos-itive cases, A comprehensive hygiene concept and office layouts adapting to social distancing rules, Installation of modern aerosol filters, Immediate pragmatic introduction of home office pos-sibilities (during lockdowns as a preferred option), New flexible work policy making it easier to work from home, Specific support information and creation of exchange options for parents, Transferring company events into virtual gatherings, Mandating / offering COVID-19 tests for colleagues working from the office, A relief bonus to compensate for home working cost (no job cuts and no short-time work), Offering vaccination for alstria employees and close relatives (in 2021)."
"Our approach was recognized by the HR excellence awards 2020 (3rd place in the category workplace man-agement), which is issued by Quadriga, a private uni-versity, and the Human Resources Manager, a specialist magazine for HR management issues in Germany."
All of them left voluntarily.
We offer stable jobs and provide long-term career pros-pects facilitated by the number of permanent contracts.
"For more information on our trainee program, see the Young talents paragraph."
"We strive to allow our employees to grow in their current positions, and we devote time and resources training them to succeed in their new roles."
"When our employees needs change or the opportunities arise, we encourage transfers to equivalent positions in dif-ferent teams and promote from within in the event of an in-house vacancy."
"In 2020, four employees were inter-nally promoted to senior positions."
"Real Estate Operations Coworking business BEEHIVE Sustainability & Future Research Transactions & Market Intelligence Development OPERATIONS ALSTRIAS TEAMS FINANCE & ADMINISTRATION Accounting & Reporting Human Resources Legal IT Office Administration Capital Markets & Corporate Finance Compensation system Especially in times of uncertainty, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to give our employees security and to recognize their performance through appropriate remuneration."
"In 2020, our board of directors initiated no job cuts and no short-time work."
"Rather, all employ-ees were paid a relief bonus for 2020 to compensate for the additional costs caused by working from home."
Responsible for setting our strategic priorities and ensuring that remuneration remains attractive and in line with the market is our Management Board.
Our man-agers are accountable for collaborating with their team members to develop annual personal targets based on the nature of their roles and for monitoring performance against those targets during annual appraisals.
Depending on the job position our employees get either (i) a fixed compensation or (ii) a (lower) fixed and variable compensation.
"The first provides more certainty, and the second one provides a potentially higher total compensation."
"Managers compensation packages always include a fixed salary and a variable, with the proportion of variable as part of the total compensation increas-ing with seniority."
"In detail, the variable compensation includes an annual bonus tied to individual performance and annual stock awards (so-called profit participation rights) that vest over two years and are triggered by the companys share performance over the period."
Annual change Bonus portion in total compensation Long-term incentives portion in total com-pensation 1) Total granted compensation without insurance and pension benefits.
"For more information, see the chapter titled Diversity and Inclusion."
"In addition, across the organiza-tion, we provide good working conditions and adhere to the statutory minimum payment standards."
"With regard to our employees freedom of association and collec-tive bargaining, the company recognizes the rights of all employees to form a workers council, set up employee representation and carry out collective bargaining to reg-ulate working conditions."
All above commitments are laid down in our Code of Conduct.
"The market benchmark refers cross-industry to 1,034 German companies and is provided by the service provider Great Place to Work."
For more information visit In 2020 we changed our employee engagement survey methodology.
"For the first time, the survey was con-ducted based on the leading international standard, the Great Place to Work Trust Model."
"In Germany alone, 1,034 companies use the same methodology, which offers us the great opportunity to benchmark."
With a trust index score of 79 % (market benchmark* was 61 %) alstria reached the highest possible rating: excellent.
We also received insights for our HR strategy considerations.
"For example, we have learned that many of our col-leagues are looking for more participation in the compa-nys direction and results."
The index score is composed based on 67 questions to the alstria employees.
They address the perception of the work environment and the company.
"Additionally, we asked for feedback on the direct managers and the team collaboration in general (22 questions)."
Nearly all recruiting is handled in-house and guided by our HR team.
"Depending on the position, we use various recruiting channels, such as online / print adver-tisement, social media, direct contact at fairs and uni-versities and alstrias intranet for employee referrals."
Our recruitment process usually involves three steps: a tele-phone interview and two on-premises interviews.
"These interviews are attended by the future direct manager of the candidate, a team member and a member of the HR team."
"During the second interview, candidates are usually asked to work on a case study."
"At all stages of the recruitment process, we place great importance on objectivity and fairness toward the applicant."
"With a focus on young professionals, we are present at universities by holding expert presentations and by supporting students in their academic work."
"In 2020, we contributed to five academic theses and four projects."
"Employee survey 2020 alstria received a trust index score of 79 % in 2020, which is compared to 1,034 other German companies (cross-industry) considered as excellent."
Young talents Trainee programs hold a special place in our corpo-rate culture.
They ease cooperation between various departments and long-term succession planning within the company.
"Therefore, we hire young professionals every year to complete a two-year program specially designed to provide hands-on experience with our real estate business."
"During these two years, the trainees change position every three to six months to a different team within the company (including the executive board team), allowing them to gain experience and insights into the different parts of our business."
We organize assessment days to select our train-ees.
"On these days, participants can demonstrate their skills in various individual and group tasks and gain insight into our corporate culture and future areas of job responsibility."
Welcome on board We warmly welcome our employees to their first day at work by introducing them to our office premises and our staff.
"Upon starting, each employee is assigned to an HR associate who remains available for any questions."
The respective department is in turn responsible for pro-viding employee-specific training and team building.
"To help new employees integrate more quickly, we organize onboarding sessions, which during the present pandemic were held digitally."
"During these days, we present our corporate values and provide specific training on our IT tools and internal procedures."
"Most importantly, the onboarding sessions offer networking opportunities for our new colleagues that help them settle into their new environment."
Training programs We offer our employees a wide range of training oppor-tunities to ensure they are equipped with the neces-sary skills to take on new challenges.
"During the annual appraisal meetings, employees build their individual training plans in collaboration with their managers and members of the HR team."
"Upon completion of a training program, participants and their direct managers discuss the effectiveness of the program to tailor their future training plans more effectively."
"In 2021 we introduced the alstria E-Learning Academy (ELA), a new digital train-ing format which also offers more advanced evaluation possibilities."
"With regards to the training content, in 2020 we further promoted our corporate culture and improved the leadership skills of our managers."
"In 2020, particular attention was paid to digital transformation and leader-ship."
"In addition, we have continued to focus on devel-oping real estate-specific skills and know-how across our team."
A detailed breakdown of all training programs offered in the year appears in the Training categories 2020 graphic.
Due to COVID-19 significantly less training was possible in 2020 compared to previous years.
"In addition, we are digitalizing part of the training."
We believe sharing knowledge and inter-esting stories across departments can encourage internal communication and build a stronger corporate culture.
"In addition, we invite experts from various fields to support our continuous learning."
"Some of the topics discussed in 2020 are listed below: Time Management, Diversity and intercultural exchange, Mental health improvement, Brand management, Good communication at work, alstria Low Carbon Design Principles for development projects."
"DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION As modern society becomes more diverse, embracing an inclusive work environment is the only way to move forward."
"The process of developing a diverse workforce starts with hiring talented people regardless of their individual characteristics, promoting people based solely on their performance and having managers who endorse equal opportunities and respect."
Diversity makes us stronger The individual differences in our company make us stron-ger and innovative visible differences such as gender and age and invisible differences such as experience or educational background.
"To protect and embrace the value of those differences, we established a Code of Conduct that applies to our employees and business partners."
"The policy prohibits discrimination against any individual on grounds of gender, age, ethnic group, skin color, nationality, social origin, sexual orientation, religion, ideology or disability throughout the working relationship with alstria."
"During a dedicated alstria Academy session, we raised awareness among our employees and managers about various dimensions of diversity."
We also take measures in the areas of recruitment and employee development to foster diversity and equal opportunity throughout the company.
Employees who experience or witness discrimina-tory incidents must report these to their direct managers and / or the compliance officer.
Employ-ees will face no sanctions due to reporting incidents.
"In 2020, no incidents of discrimination were reported."
Gender diversity Our Management Board is committed to promoting gen-der diversity and increasing the representation of women in management positions.
"In 2020, 97 women and 70 men worked for alstria."
"Although we firmly believe that candidates applying for any job position need to be selected based on their talent and not on their gender, we recognize our indus-try has a deficit of women in management positions."
"Our Management Board has, therefore, set a 30 % target quota for women in the first management level below the Management Board (Head of Departments), and our Supervisory Board has assigned itself a similar target for its own composition."
"In December 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to raise the target for the proportion of women on the Manage-ment Board to at least 30 %."
"This target was not reached as of December 31, 2020 and will apply until Decem-ber31, 2024."
We are proud that our approach to gender diversity has been recognized in the last two years by the 2020 and 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.
Gender pay gap Our Management Board strives to provide equal remu-neration for similar job assignments across the company.
"To promote pay parity, alstria monitors and compares the annual pay of women and men across all manage-ment levels."
Although women are well represented in our com-pany the gender pay gap increased slightly (+1 % points) in favor of male employees compared to last year.
We are confident that our pay gap is not caused by our approach to setting pay levels but is driven by the structure of our workforce.
We also believe that some real estate and technical core disciplines that tend to attract a higher market pay are underrepresented by female candidates.
"Further, we monitor the gender pay gap across indi-viduals with similar job assignments and experience."
"Non-management level Employees with similar job assignments 1) Employees who were absent for more than two months, newly hired / released or promoted to this category during the reporting year are excluded from the con-solidation basis."
"As the pension age and the number of years each employee works for the company increase, we expect to have equal representation of four generations working together in the future."
This new normal calls for flexibility and foresight in management.
"We, thus, respect, recruit and promote employees regardless of age."
"Retirement programs are not yet applied at our company, as our staff has not approached retirement age."
"In comparison groups, we classify employees with comparable jobs to better demonstrate the pay gap across the company."
"Therefore, certain colleagues with a relatively high salary are heavily weighted."
We concluded that the 2020 gap is explained by methodological / statistical reasons and will continue to monitor the topic closely.
WORK-LIFE BALANCE We recognize our responsibility as an employer to react to lifestyle and societal changes and offer employees solutions to balance their work and personal lives.
"To promote the health and well-being of our employees, we provide a range of health care programs and com-prehensive health management."
"Health and safety management As a German employer, alstria follows legal obligations for occupational safety and health protection and has a health and safety management system in place."
The Committee for Safety at Work is responsible for monitoring and improving occupational health and safety.
"Members consist of the Management Board, an elected security officer, a company doctor and an indus-trial safety expert."
"To address health and safety hazards at work in a timely manner, we conduct twice-yearly independent health and safety audits across all corpo-rate offices."
"Any risk identified during these audits is addressed by the Committee for Safety at Work, and corrective actions are taken to eliminate it, including the involvement of team leaders."
"Our health and safety system is anchored to a respec-tive policy, which has been applied consistently to our organization since 2010."
"It supports the following: Meeting applicable legal requirements, Preventing occupational injury and reducing illness risks, Offering our employees training in health and safety topics, and Working closely with authorities, trade associations and institutions on these topics."
"To increase awareness among our employees of health and safety, we provide training upon hiring, which is organized by the security officer and complemented by annual updates."
Each employee bears responsibility for following the health and safety policy and reporting potential risks.
"In addition, we offer free participation in first aid courses every three years."
"In 2020, due to COVID-19 unfortunately it was not possible to conduct first aid courses."
"Health and well-being programs To help our employees remain healthy, we support them with a yearly influenza vaccine, vision care according to DGUV principle G37 and business-travel accident insur-ance."
"In addition, we support our employees physical well-being by subsidizing monthly memberships to a sports club available in all big German cities and in eight countries throughout Europe."
We also have been paying close attention to the impact of mental health.
We have thus formed an inter-nal task force to spot the triggers and signs of men-tal health issues within our working environment.
"Most recently, we introduced a mental health app, Self-apy, which offers psychological support for people with stress, depression, anxiety or eating disorders."
The sci-entifically approved app service is supported by regular telephone calls and a message function with a personal psychologist.
"Adaptable & healthy workspace Our head offices are located in a renovated building of UNESCO cultural heritage in Hamburg, overlooking the main central station."
The offices were designed to meet high comfort levels and can be adjusted flexibly to address various rates of occupancy.
"They further embrace an open culture defined by middle glass zones that serve as think tanks, lounges, nap areas, phone booths and recreational areas."
"To maintain a cer-tain privacy level, all think tanks feature a foil coating."
"Each office unit features adjustable-height desks for extra comfort, sound-absorbing privacy panels and furniture on wheels to allow employees to shape the space on their own terms."
We also offer free bicycle lots to make it easier for our employees to commute by bicycle.
"Finally, to support e-mobility, we have installed e-charging sta-tions in our garage."
"These lower numbers are also explained by a moderate flu wave in 2020 (due to measures to contain COVID-19), which limits comparability with previous years."
It is our ambition to stay below the German average every year.
"In 2020, we recorded no fatalities across the organization, but we did record two work-re-lated injuries."
"Flexible working Besides statutory rights, we offer our employees trust-based working hours, which they can arrange with their direct managers considering their own and the business needs."
"Our employees can choose to work off-site, for example, at our coworking business (BEEHIVE)."
"In 2020, to protect our employees from COVID-19, alstria released a flexible work policy which increases the possibilities of our colleagues to work from home."
This was alstrias standard work option in 2020.
In 2021 the management board decided that this policy would remain in place even after the end of the COVID-19 cri-sis.
"However, working from home must be approved by superiors and it is limited to a maximum of 80 days per year and three consecutive days."
"To maintain successful remote work, we equip our employees with laptops, mobile phones, and 24-hour remote access to the companys infrastructure and IT support."
Arbeitsmarkt-und Berufsforschung.
Family support Corporate benefits We support our employees balance of work and family responsibilities by offering (at their request) part-time models.
"Upon returning to work, new parents are wel-comed to choose their suitable working model, and we provide the same working conditions for full and part-time employees."
"In 2020, the number of employees working part-time was 21 %."
"For employees with dependent family members, we offer a home-care model."
This includes the possibility to reduce ones working time by up to 20 hours a week for a period up to two years.
"During this period, the employee receives a pay deduction of up to 25 %."
"After the end of the home-care period, the employee returns to their contractually agreed working time and continues to receive a reduced salary for as long as the home-care model was used."
We offer our employees a wide range of benefits in addition to those for health and well-being.
These are provided to all full-and part-time employees.
Tempo-rary employees are normally not eligible for the benefits outlined below.
Public transport pass: We cover commuting to work costs by subsidizing the local public transportation (monthly or annual tickets) fully.
"Competitive vacation plan: We offer 30 days of vaca-tion, which is 33 % above statutory requirements."
Sports club membership: We subsidize the monthly membership to various fitness venues accessible in all big cities of Germany.
"Company cars: We provide company cars (from 2021 only fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles) to managers, technicians and selected other employees; for example, those who must work off-site."
"Pension plan: In addition to the legally mandated social pension, we offer a voluntary company pension plan (excluding the Management Board)."
"The company matches employee contributions up to EUR 1,320 per year."
Electricity contract: We offer a fair-price contract of renewable electricity for private use.
Free access to coworking: We offer use of coworking BEEHIVE spaces.
Meals: We offer canteen options in our Hamburg office.
We provide leasing options of e-bikes and bikes to all employees.
Sabbatical option: We offer employees who have been working for more than five years at alstria the option of sabbaticals in agreement with their supervisors and HR.
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICAL CONDUCT We expect our employees to act with integrity and to comply with our ethical standards.
Only in this way can we maintain our good reputation and public trust.
"To systematically protect the company from compliance risks and promote ethical behavior among our employ-ees, we have set up a company-wide compliance system."
Compliance system Our Management Board has built a compliance system to assure proper implementation of the groups ethi-cal standards.
"These standards include a set of internal behavioral guidelines and codes of conduct (CoC) for employees and suppliers, which are available on our website."
New employees receive the CoC on their first day at work as part of the welcome package and must accept its rules in writing.
"The alstria compliance officer is responsible for ensur-ing legal conformity in the core compliance fields in the best possible way and enhancing the entire system, con-sidering the constantly evolving legal environment."
"The officer is also bound to monitor compliance within the group and conduct compliance risk assessments every quarter, which are presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"The Audit Committee, in turn, is responsible for controlling the scope and intensity of our compliance activities, including overseeing internal compliance-related audits."
Our employees are encouraged to raise concerns about compliance with their direct managers or the compliance officer.
"Employees can also use an external 24 / 7 whis-tleblower hotline, through which they can anonymously report violations of the code of conduct or the compa-nys internal guidelines."
"In 2021, we plan to launch a whistleblower portal / website."
"Our policy explicitly offers protection for whistleblowers, and employees face no sanctions as a consequence of reporting incidents."
All new employees receive training regarding compliance upon hiring.
"Updates to our existing policies are imme-diately communicated via the companys intranet, and refresher courses are provided to all employees."
Corruption and bribery policy alstria does not tolerate corrupt business practices by employees or external suppliers acting on behalf of alstria.
Corruption is understood to be the acceptance or granting of advantages or benefits which are used to take unfair influence on business or official decisions.
This expressly includes bribes in any form.
Monetary gifts to business partners are strictly prohibited and perceived as (attempted) bribery.
"During an ongoing negotiation any kind of grants, invitations for events or hospitality are not permitted."
"Employees of alstria are not allowed to offer, promise or grant office bearers monetary or non-monetary benefits of any kind."
"Financial contributions (including in kind) may be made to organizations such as industry, trade and busi-ness associations, think tanks and research projects as well as for charitable purposes as part of alstrias corpo-rate citizenship activities."
"However, financial contribu-tions are made voluntarily, without expectation of any consideration in return, within the framework of applica-ble laws and regulations, and always require the approval of the management board."
All financial contributions made are to be reported to the Sustainability & Future Research department and will be published in alstrias sustainability report.
"Financial contributions to politi-cians, political parties and political campaigns are not permitted and will not be made directly nor indirectly."
"To protect the group from corruption risks, we have implemented an early-warning risk identification sys-tem that evaluates and monitors all associated risks on a quarterly basis at minimum."
The compliance officer oversees the compliance with anti-corruption practices.
"In addition, we maintain a four-eye principle as a control mechanism for most inter-nal processes."
"In 2020, no incidents of corruption in rela-tion to employees and business partners were officially reported to alstria."
Human rights policy alstria operates a human rights policy intended to rec-ognize and safeguard the human rights of all citizens in the business areas under our control and asks our sup-pliers to act alike.
Our policy is built upon the principles set out by the United Nations on business and human rights and the International Labour Organizations labor standards.
We monitor human rights risks across our organiza-tion on a quarterly basis as part of our compliance risk assessment.
"As the group operates in Germany, where social regulations are well developed through democratic frameworks, human rights are protected by German law to a high degree."
"However, we recognize that potential risks might occur across our supply chain, including risks related to unworthy working conditions in construction sites or in the production of building products and ser-vices used by our suppliers."
"To mitigate potential impacts, we have a compliance management system in place designed to observe the adherence of high ethical standards within our organiza-tion."
Those ethical standards also apply to the drafting of contracts with suppliers for minimizing noncompliance to human rights.
INCLUSIVE FINANCIAL GROWTH Our value creation is based on cooperation with local and regional service providers.
It enables the creation of well-paying jobs and gives us the opportunity to sup-port the communities in which we operate.
Our financial profile We report changes in the companys structure and finan-cial performance primarily in our annual report and in the investor relations section of our website.
The fol-lowing infographic provides financial information we consider particularly important for delivering our sus-tainability goals.
"OUR OFFICE DESIGN With work no longer confined to a single location, todays office users are increasingly looking for flexi-ble, collaborative, and engaging workspaces."
"By staying a step ahead, we have already embraced the coworking mentality in our real estate strategy, and we have real-ized flexibility in our space and in our leases."
We understand the pivotal role that our buildings play in their environment and the impacts they may impose on their occupants and the surrounding communities.
"When we design an office space, our goal is to create long-term value for the tenants, the local communities, our partners, and ourselves."
"Thus, we consider the fol-lowing factors, for example, important for increasing the long-term value of our office buildings: health and safety, human-centered office layouts, connections to transportation and recreational areas, and accessibility."
"Health, safety, and human-centered office layout Before making any significant acquisition, we exercise due diligence by thoroughly examining all potential safety, regulatory, and environmental risks that could pose health threats to the buildings occupants and the surrounding communities."
"During the operation of the buildings and as required by law, we annually inspect all buildings in our portfolio to identify and remedy potential deficiencies in technical, safety, and access issues."
"Before any refurbishment activity begins, we commu-nicate the timeline of our construction activities to the buildings immediate neighbors."
"When conflicts arise, we try to react quickly and find solutions for the office users and tenants, which sometimes means rescheduling our heavy construction work to Saturdays to minimize noise and disturbances."
"During refurbishment, the appointed construction company oversees its workers health and safety."
"Furthermore, BG BAU, the body responsible for statutory accident insurance for the construction industry, regularly supervises our construction sites to ensure construction company workers are safe and have the required train-ing."
"As German law requires, we appoint one health and safety coordinator (SiGeKo) for each construction site to ensure optimal occupational health and safety standards."
"When necessary, SiGeKo can proceed with closing a site or with discharging workers or construction companies."
"In 2020, no fatal accidents occurred at our construction sites or in our offices."
"However, we recorded one serious work-related accident at one of our construction sites."
The incident at one of our service providers was handled in accordance with all legal requirements.
"Connections to transportation and recreational areas When it comes to real estate, location is everything."
"In the context of growing cities, the locations of offices and their access to transportation systems partially deter-mine their rentability."
"Due to the immovable nature of our buildings and the limited influence we have over their surroundings, it is essential for us to understand their connectivity to the urban fabric."
"For this reason, we regularly examine our portfolio against the following criteria: distance to public transport (metros, buses, trams, bicycle-sharing, and ridesharing); distance to airports, railway stations, and highways; access to electric-vehicle charging stations; distance to food supplies, drugstores, pharmacies, banks, and cafs; and distance to recreation areas."
The results of our most recent study showed that 70 % of our portfolio has good to very good access to trans-portation systems and local supplies.
"This is attributable mainly to the composition of our portfolio, with build-ings situated in dense metropolitan areas."
"Thus, we aim to offer common areas that are safe for people with disabilities."
"To gain better insight into our portfolios disability-friendliness, we have exam-ined our common areas based on the following criteria: easy access to the building, accessible entrance areas and ramps, appropriately dimensioned circulation areas and corridors, accessible stairs and elevators, suitable handrails on stairs and ramps, accessible doors and passages, and accessible sanitary spaces."
"Of all of the examined properties, 99 % met our criteria for barrier-free buildings, demonstrating that most of our buildings are appropriate for people with disabilities, and the remaining buildings can be modified easily."
Our coworking business: BEEHIVE The world of work is changing.
"The trend toward a shar-ing economy is flourishing, and the number of coworkers worldwide has increased fivefold since 2015."
Flexible concepts that promote exchange and offer inspiring envi-ronments are in demand.
"With BEEHIVE, we offer this type of working environment, which is also an important contribution to innovation ecosystems and thus to the future of the economy."
"For over five years, the BEEHIVE team has welcomed thousands of freelancers, founders, start-ups, and anyone else who wanted to enjoy the benefits of a coworking environment in our BEEHIVEs."
"The spaces are open 24 / 7 and offer 365-day access to flexible workspaces in all major German cities ( Dsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, and Hamburg)."
Coworkers simply book their workspace online and receive immediate and unlimited access to the BEEHIVE.
"In their personal online account, coworkers can adjust bookings, plan meetings, or invite guests."
The lack of a cancellation period and membership fees also ensures flexibility.
BEEHIVE Enterprise More and more companies are discovering the benefits of combining coworking with traditional office environ-ments.
Now they are looking for hybrid solutions that are easy to implement.
We address this trend with our BEEHIVE Enterprise offer.
"With this new service, compa-nies can experiment with hybrid office concepts without making commitments."
A company account offers possibilities to assign coworking permissions and control expenses.
"With smart budget monitoring, full control over expenses is possible and the company pays for only what the team really uses."
The usage behavior of employees can be analyzed.
"In this way, companies can see how the new option is being accepted and can derive future office plans from this."
"Employees can access the coworking spaces in Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Dsseldorf around the clock, 365days a year, with workspaces for every need."
The booking conditions are flexible: there is neither a can-cellation period nor a minimum term.
"We have a highly diverse and locally based supply chain, with providers ranging from multinational companies to small businesses."
This graphic shows the major third parties we work with in our operations and business administration processes.
"Dealing with ESG risks in the supply chain The Environmental, Social and Governance ESG risk pro-file of alstrias supply chain is structurally low because of the following characteristics: We operate only in Germany, and all our Tier 1 sup-pliers work under German law for us."
"Thus, the ESG conduct of our suppliers is thoroughly screened and strongly enforced by Germanys numerous, compre-hensive ESG compliance regulations."
"In addition, our business depends only to a small extent on the value addition of our suppliers since we mainly buy and manage existing buildings."
"For example, our development / building program usually affects less than 10 % of our portfolio volume / total lettable area."
"Further, we dont buy building materials ( non-Tier 1 suppliers) directly."
We buy the assembled service.
"In addition, we ask our employees to report to their superiors or the compliance officer if it comes to their attention that suppliers infringe upon the law or the Code of Conduct for Suppliers."
"Furthermore, alstria has established a compliance hotline with an external law firm through which employ-ees may report violations anonymously."
"In 2021, we plan to launch a whistleblower website that is available for our employees and our supplier network."
"In FY 2020 (as in the past), no violation of human rights was recorded across our organization."
"Conse-quently, no corrective action plans and no remedial actions were necessary."
"Thus, it is not justifiable to allo-cate company resources to comprehensive site-specific assessments or risk mitigation plans."
Working with locally based suppliers We engage third-party suppliers in our development projects and in the regular maintenance of our buildings.
This invest-ment supported around 900 jobs in the construction sector.
"To support the local economy, we aim to engage, whenever possible, with local small-and medium-sized companies."
"CONTRIBUTION TO COMMUNITIES As a real estate company, we have a direct influence on the appearances of the cities in which we invest."
We thus see our duty as that of a responsible citizen: to enhance the quality of life in our local communities.
Our corporate citizenship activities and our engagement in preserving historical buildings are important to mention in this context.
Corporate citizenship We see corporate citizenship and philanthropic activities as opportunities to increase important intangible value drivers of our business such as employee motivation and loyalty.
"In addition, increasing the quality of life in the local communities where we operate contributes to our social license to operate and to the general goodwill of local politicians, civil society organizations, and service providers."
The latter are essential to our business.
"To operationalize this understanding, we focus on the fol-lowing priorities."
"Charitable donations (mainly to local nonprofit organi-zations working for children in need), Community investment (support for local communi-ties, especially through discounted leases for nonprofit organizations, arts, and culture groups, and biodiversity projects), and Commercial activities (sponsorship, mainly for local sports clubs that support children from difficult social backgrounds)."
"Further, our coworking BEEHIVEs offer honey to their coworkers in collaboration with regional beekeepers to support local production."
"BEEHIVE events Our subsidiary, BEEHIVE, organizes regular free events in its spaces, addressing topics that range from empowering women in businesses to helping young entrepreneurs set up their businesses."
It also organizes start-up challenges that offer newly founded companies exposure to poten-tial clients and investors.
"In total, BEEHIVE organized 13events in 2020, 11 of them took place virtually."
"Charitable donations Every Christmas, our employees donate presents to support the causes of the nonprofit organization ala-din in Hamburg."
The organization aims to improve the upbringing of children in need of assistance.
"In 2020, we also supported with a EUR 20,000 rental discount the childrens organization Straenkinder Projekt KIDS, which was our former tenant."
"We also paid for memberships to organi-zations that support the development of cities, such as the Interessengemeinschaft City Sd."
"Additionally, we offer some of our buildings for art exhi-bitions and thus support the work of local artists and promote dialogue in our communities."
"For the 2020 2021 art exhibition titled MIND the GAP, we offered the remarkable paternoster-style ele-vators and the entrance of the historic Bieberhaus build-ing, which is close to the central station in Hamburg."
"This series of exhibitions is thematically dedicated to the question of how existing building material can be reinterpreted, how urban space can be rethought and how social participation can be redefined."
"In addition to hosting the exhibition, we invite the artists to our on-site coworking space BEEHIVE to discuss their work and share their thoughts with our coworking community."
"Preservation of historic buildings When the market presents us with a buying opportu-nity, we acquire historic buildings and take over their demanding restoration to maintain their cultural value."
"Notable older buildings in particular, when properly restored, can capitalize great returns on leases."
"Two buildings in our portfolio, located in Hamburgs Speicherstadt and its historic Kontorhaus districts, are on the UNESCO World Heritage List."
Our most prominent refurbishment project in the last year was the historic Geesthof building in the heart of Hamburg.
Architect Hermann Hger erected the building in the 1920s for Hamburgs health authority.
"Originally built with six full stories, the building impresses with its expressionist clinker-brick front, southeastern faade in Bauhaus style, and art nouveau interior elements."
"However, its architectural significance was severely damaged during World War II, when the building lost almost two floors and its distinctive crown."
"After its last occupant moved out in 2018, we seized the opportunity for a comprehensive modernization that will restore the buildings former character."
"The concept we developed reflects the style of the 1920s and includes the reconstruction of the two destroyed stories, the restoration of the faade with clinker bricks, and the preservation of its distinctive staircase."
"In our experience, historical restoration projects usu-ally increase allocated capital by almost 50 %."
"For our Geesthof project, we have planned an investment of around EUR 11 million, with a return of 6 %."
A ABOUT THIS REPORT This is alstrias twelfth sustainability report.
"We pub-lish this product every year in November to provide our readers with comprehensive information about our companys sustainability approach and its progress in environmental, social, and governance areas of the pre-vious financial year."

"Furthermore, due to changes in the measurement in the current reporting period, the 2019 values for waste for recovery were adjusted."
Selection of topics (materiality) Topics (including sub-topics) and reporting boundaries were selected based on the results of our materiality analysis process.
"In 2015, we conducted a comprehen-sive baseline materiality assessment including a large stakeholder consultation."
"Based on our ongoing stake-holder engagement, which increasingly relates to ESG topics, we challenge the results annually."
"For example, we continually gather feedback from shareholders as well as political and civil society stakeholders through our investor and public relations departments."
"Inter-nal feedback from operational departments (real estate operations, development, transactions & market intelli-gence) is very important to evaluate the importance of ESG topics for our customers, service providers, and the market in general."
"External audit For the sixth consecutive year, we engaged an auditing firm to conduct a third-party evaluation of all environ-mental and social data, as well as associated content presented in the chapters Our Buildings and Our Peo-ple."
The EPRA tables in Appendix D were also included in the assurance scope.
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprfungs-gesellschaft verified the current report.
"With our human ressource department, we analyze employee-related topics."
"Finally, through the work of our sustainability and future research department, we screen the latest scientific/regulatory developments and best practices."
"In addition, we discuss ESG related topics with our industry peers through associations and think tanks."
"For further information on our baseline material-ity analysis refer to the Sustainability Report 2015/16, pages 24 to 27."
"Except for the topic workplace experi-ence, which was added in 2018, and the topic reducing our carbon emissions, which has gained importance in recent years, all remaining topics are weighted the same."
"Our material topics are presented in this report under the chapters Our Buildings, Our People, and Sound Business."
The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 establish an important path for building a better world by 2030.
"The overarching goals include ending poverty, reducing inequality, and stopping climate change."

The legal representatives of alstria are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the Report-ing Criteria.
This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual qualitative and quantitative sus-tainability disclosures which are reasonable in the cir-cumstances.
"Furthermore, this responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Report in a way that is free of intended or unintended material misstatements."
Independence and quality assurance on the part of the auditing firm We are independent from the entity in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set out in legal provisions and professional pronounce-ments and have fulfilled our additional professional obli-gations in accordance with these requirements.
"Our audit firm applies the legal provisions and pro-fessional pronouncements for quality assurance, in par-ticular the professional code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the qual-ity assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprfer, IDW) regard-ing quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDWQS1)."
"Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the dis-closures within the sections Our Buildings and Our People as well as the Appendix D EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures Environment portfolio, Environ-ment company and Social based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement."
We conducted our work in accordance with the Inter-national Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
"This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Report for the period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, has not been prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the aforementioned Reporting Cri-teria."
"We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each sustainability disclosure."
In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement.
The choice of assurance proce-dures is subject to the auditors own judgement.
"Within the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures: Inquiries of personnel on Group level responsible for the materiality analysis, in order to gain an understand-ing of the processes for identifying material sustainabil-ity topics and respective reporting boundaries of alstria office REIT-AG A risk analysis, including a media search, to identify relevant information on alstrias sustainability perfor-mance in the reporting period."
"Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of the disclosures and information included in the scope of the assurance engagement, including the consolidation of the data."
"Interviews with relevant staff on Group level respon-sible for providing and consolidating the data and information, as well as carrying out internal control procedures on the data and information, including the explanatory notes."
Analytical assessment of data and trends which were consolidated on Group level.
Assessment of local data collection and reporting pro-cesses and reliability of reported data via a sampling.
Evaluation of selected internal and external documents.
Assessment of the overall presentation of the selected sustainability information included in our scope.
"Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and the evidence received to obtain assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the disclosures included in the scope of our assurance engagement for the business year from January 1, 2020, to Decem-ber 31, 2020, published in the Report within the sec-tions Our Buildings and Our People as well as the AppendixD EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures Environment portfolio, Environment company and Social, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria."
"Restriction of Use / Clause on General Engagement Terms This report is issued for the purposes of the Manage-ment Board of alstria office REIT-AG, Hamburg, only."
We assume no responsibility with regard to any third parties.
"Our assignment for the Management Board of alstria office REIT-AG, Hamburg, and professional lia-bility is governed by the General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprfer (German Public Auditors) and Wirtschaftsprfungsgesellschaften (German Public Audit Firms) (Allgemeine Auftragsbedingungen fr Wirtschafts-prfer und Wirtschaftsprfungsgesellschaften) in the version dated January 1, 2017 ( )."
"D EPRA SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES In this section, we provide a detailed picture of our sus-tainability performance based on the third edition of the EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines."
"Our focus remains, as always, in providing concise and transparent data."
"Similar to previous years, we increased the level of disclosure and breadth of our data sets."
"In the following tables, we present separately our performance against environmental, social, and gov-ernance measures."
"We also exhibit absolute and like-for-like (LfL) measures, as well as appropriate intensity indicators (Int)."
EPRA-specific terminology Absolute performance measures (Abs) Absolute performance measures (Abs) for environmen-tal data represent the total consumption of the build-ing portfolio for the full reporting year.
"Likewise, Abs of social data include the total number of employees for the full reporting year."
Like-for-like (LfL) performance measures Like-for-like (LfL) performance measures for environ-mental data complement the Abs measures.
They facili-tate a comparison of the consumption data for the same sized portfolio for the last two reporting years.
"Disclosure on an LfL basis demonstrates more effectively a change in performance that is not affected by fluctuations in a portfolios size (through acquisitions, disposals, and refurbishments)."
"LfL measures are not used for social data; instead, absolute figures from the last two report-ing years are provided to facilitate comparison."
Intensity indicators (Int) Intensity indicators (Int) for environmental data pro-vide the amount of consumption per unit of a suitable denominator.
Typical denominators for office buildings are per lettable area and per workstation (one work-station equals 25 m of office space).
The main denom-inator for building intensity indicators is per lettable area.
"In addition, the denominator for alstrias corporate offices consumption is per total number of employ-ees for the reporting year."
"Finally, the denominators for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are per total num-ber of employees and per open market value (OMV)."
"Likewise, the denominators for social data are per total/ average number of employees."
"In 2020, our portfolio included 109 buildings."
"However, we present the environmental performance for only 99 buildings because by the end of the reporting year, nine buildings were under construction, and one was recently acquired."
"In LfL measures, we disclose buildings that have been in operation consistently for the most recent two reporting years in full."
"In 2020, we employed 167 employees, including trainees."
"In line with alstrias IFRS Report, employees are defined as all staff including trainees but not stu-dents, employees in maternity/parental leave, appren-tices, interns, board (CEO and CFO), and contract workers from temporary employment agencies (which alstria does not work with)."
Data limitations Environmental data Collecting consumption data from our buildings has never been easy.
"For a considerable part of our portfolio, namely the shared services in common areas and some tenant areas, we obtain consumption data in real time using smart meters."
"For the rest, namely all tenant-ob-tained consumption, we obtain records from our ten-ants, over which we have no control and for which we have no verification procedures."
"However, we choose to report all available data and make no estimates to fill gaps, except for information that is required for benchmarking against the CRREEM or SBTi reduction pathways."
Due to the COVID-19 crisis one of our most reliable sources for tenant electricity data was not able to provide us the data for 15 single-tenant buildings for this report in time.
"In this one case, we decided to make an extrapolation for these buildings."
The reason for this is that we have measurement series from the last 10 years and consumption has been very constant in the past.
This concerns approximately 4 % of the total energy consumption in our portfolio.
"Also due to COVID-19, various indicators related to our offices have decreased significantly."
"For example, GHG emissions from business trips were reduced from 120 tCO2e to 38 tCO2e."
"Regarding water utilities, we usually submeter water exclusively to our tenants and can therefore report these data reliably."
"However, in the case of single-let buildings, our tenants directly obtain water; therefore, we must rely solely on their records."
"Finally, regarding the waste generation in our portfo-lio, we can report data with a certain reliability because information is collected and managed by an external waste management company in 69 of 99 buildings."
"For the rest of the portfolio that has not yet been intro-duced to a waste management system, we choose not to disclose the data."
"The deadline for the collection of our 2020 environ-Social data For the data associated with the pay gap between women and men, namely the EPRA diversity pay indi-cator, we compare the total compensation of female employees to that of male employees, including fixed salaries, bonuses, and stock options, as well as the leas-ing of company vehicles."
"In addition, we provide the female-to-male pay gap for various management levels, including managers (management level 1), employees who lead teams with a reporting line two levels or less from the management board (management level 2), and the rest of the staff with no extended managerial responsibilities."
"For data associated with employees health and safety, namely the EPRA employee health and safety indicator, we calculate our employees absent days as working days according to the Hamburg model."
"GHG emissions accounting In line with the operational approach of the GHG Proto-col Standard, we divide our carbon emissions into three categories: Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions (Dir) resulting from our companys vehicles and gas heating in our corpo-rate offices."
"Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions (Indir) resulting from the consumption of electricity in the common areas of our multi-let buildings, as well as electricity and heating consumption from our corporate offices."
"Scope 3 emissions: Indirect emissions (Indir) arising from business travel, employee commutes, and energy consumption in tenant areas."
"In addition, there are two available methods for cal-culating Scope 2 and 3 emissions."
"For our 2020 GHG accounting, we used the latest available conversion factors from the German Federal Environment Agencys Umweltbundesamt, Climate Change | 45/2021 Strommix 2020, published in May 2021, and Umweltbundesamt Kohlendioxid-Emis-sionsfaktoren fr die deutsche Berichterstattung atmo-sphrischer Emissionen, published in March 2020."
"Further-more, for our portfolios emissions from district heating, we used factor data from our regional district heating suppliers."
"However, in most cases we do not have the knowledge about the type of supply."

"F CARBON DASHBOARD When defining GHG mitigation programs, we have several options."
The following carbon dashboard aims to give an overview of this landscape.
"With the carbon dashboard, we would also like to emphasize that we see a hierarchy when it comes to prioritizing GHG mitigation measures (see graphic)."
"Consequently, GHG avoidance has the greatest potential, as it pre-vents emissions from occurring in the first place."
"If emissions cannot be avoided, they can at least be minimized using efficient technology and smart management."
"A fuel switch is often the first and simplest solution to reduce/replace emissions, but it often only changes the energy medium without saving energy."
The last option in the GHG impact hierarchy is to make additional contributions to offsetting and compensating via high hanging fruits projects.
This can at least help others to reduce their emissions even if it is not suitable to balance out your own emissions.
