      "##END_OF_PAGE##4INTRODUCTION Martin LöckerCOOThomas G. WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GärtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signiﬁcance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the ﬁrst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG – it stands for the “S“ in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed  – just underscored – the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM’s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reﬂected in the focus on green building, green ﬁnancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conﬁrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the ﬁrst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signiﬁcance of ESG for UBM – also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\f",

As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market. UBM shares are listed in Vienna‘s Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments ﬁts per-fectly with UBM’s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our ﬁnancing to green ﬁnancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ﬁve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond ﬁnancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the ﬁrst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ﬁve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM’s commitment to reach a speciﬁc ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green ﬁnancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green ﬁnancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit ﬁnancing represents the next step to even more green ﬁnancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for “green loans“. Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate ﬁnancing. Over the longer term, we also see “green bonds“ as attrac-tive tools for green ﬁnancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speciﬁc use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien für Europas Metropolen.

That begins in our ofﬁces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM’s training and educational programmes as well as our “UBM Day”, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That’s more than all trafﬁc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Efﬁcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

      "##END_OF_PAGE##2929Two days of pure UBM cultureMore than 200 of our colleagues from Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria took part in our “UBM Day“ 2021 in Vienna at the end of October. The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community “live“. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the ﬁrst time as a “green meeting“ in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements – from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering ﬁrm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the “Caritas am Himmel“ during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the “Lichtblickhof“ brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na‘s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations – and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM’s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead, €50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria’s only stationary children’s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in difﬁcult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children‘s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankeschön\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM‘s underground car park\f",

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GärtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signiﬁcance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the ﬁrst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG – it stands for the “S“ in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed  – just underscored – the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM’s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reﬂected in the focus on green building, green ﬁnancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conﬁrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the ﬁrst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signiﬁcance of ESG for UBM – also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##4\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\n\\nsummarised in four words:  \\n\\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\n\\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\n\\nIt represents the focal point  \\n\\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\n\\nvarious aspects of  \\n\\nsustainability in connection  \\n\\nwith the Environment,  \\n\\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n\\n66\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n7\\n7\\n\\n1.

Our business model.  \\nExplained in brief.\\n\\ngreen.  smart.  and  more.  That  summarises  the  strategy  of \\nUBM  Development  AG  in  four  words.  Explained  in  brief. \\nBecause  anyone  who  plans  for  the  future  must  develop \\nbuildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically \\nappealing, where people feel well. \\n\\nnow  the  determining  factors  for  our  actions.  In  2021  UBM \\napplied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-\\nmitted  to  compliance  with  the  UN  Sustainable  Develop-\\nment  Goals,  and  became  an  ofﬁcial  supporter  of  the  Task \\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\n\\nWe  develop  properties  for  Europe’s  major  cities.  In  line \\nwith our core strategy, the focus is on green building and \\nsmart ofﬁce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, \\nMunich  and  Prague.  With  over  150  years  of  experience, \\nUBM provides a full range of development services – from \\nplanning to marketing – from a single source.\\n\\nEcological and social aspects play an important role in every \\ndecision  because  our  actions  today  design  the  working \\nand living space of tomorrow. Gold from EcoVadis, Prime  \\nStatus from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-\\ntiﬁcations  in  recent  years  underscore  UBM’s  commitment \\nto sustainability. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic signiﬁcantly increased the pace of \\nchange in this area. Ecological and social sustainability are \\n\\nUBM  Development  AG  is  listed  in  the  prime  market  seg-\\nment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets \\nthe  highest  transparency  standards.  That  not  only  means \\nﬁnancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all \\nother aspects of the business model.\\n\\nUBM’s corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but \\nits activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-\\ntan regions in ﬁve countries – Germany, Austria, the Czech \\nRepublic,  Poland  and  the  Netherlands.  In  many  of  these \\nmarkets,  UBM  has  been  active  as  a  real  estate  developer \\nfor many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner \\n– not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-\\nties and ﬁnancing banks.\\n\\n2-1, 2-6\\n\\nT E A M   P E R F O R M A N C E   A L O N G   T H E   E N T I R E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nPlanning and \\nengineering\\n\\nProject \\nmanagement\\n\\nFinancing\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nProperties for Europe‘s metropolises.  \\nSustainable, technologically and emotionally \\nintelligent and with added value. \\n\\nU B M   I N   E U R O P E\\n\\nThe Hague\\n\\nHamburg\\n\\nDüsseldorf\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nFrankfurt\\n\\nPrague\\n\\nMunich\\n\\nVienna\\n\\nInnsbruck\\n\\nGraz\\n\\nWarsaw\\n\\nKatowice\\n\\nKrakow\\n\\n8\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nEvery decision we make in connection with the development \\nof a property has an impact on the global climate for the \\ncoming decades. It is a conviction that is also reflected in \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. \\n\\n1.2. Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand  setting  a  value  for  the  sale  which  can  be  included  in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\nproﬁtability and risk. UBM’s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a “one-stop shop“. We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management, ﬁnancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor ﬁnal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM’s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and ofﬁce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM’s  core  markets  is  also  well-ﬁlled  for  the \\nfuture  with  €2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nofﬁce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue  of  roughly  €300m  in  its  standing  investment  portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM’s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n“Pure  Play  Developer“.  Nearly  75%  of  the  company’s  book \\nvalue is attributable to development.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\nU B M   –   C O R E   C O M P E T E N C E\\n\\nsell with  \\nadded value\\n\\ndevelop\\n\\n10\\n\\nbuy\\n\\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nT H E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nS\\n\\nN\\n\\nT I O\\n\\nA\\n\\nR\\n\\nAsset \\nmanagement\\n\\nE\\n\\nP\\n\\nO\\n\\n Acquisition\\n\\nZoning / \\nbuilding rights\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nP\\n\\nT\\n\\nI\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nI\\n\\nT\\n\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nI\\n\\nL\\n\\nA\\n\\nE\\n\\nR\\n\\nSale / \\nexit\\n\\nRental / \\nmarketing\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n        Financing\\n\\nS\\n\\nT\\n\\nR\\n\\nU\\n\\nCTIO N\\n\\n1.3.  Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM‘s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nreﬂected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe ﬁrst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the ﬁnancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM’s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM’s strate-\\ngic transformation into a “Pure Play Developer“, the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated – for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a “Pure Play Developer“, UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering – in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different  ﬁelds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate qualiﬁcations. There were no signiﬁcant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.  International presence  \\n\\nand stable shareholder structure \\n\\nUBM Development and its subsidiaries have an efﬁcient \\nlocal network which guarantees competitive positioning in \\nthe individual markets. In addition to the headquarters of \\nUBM Development AG in Vienna, the following operating \\nsubsidiaries are active in real estate development: \\n\\n(cid:132) \\n\\n UBM Development Deutschland GmbH and  \\nAlba Bau Projekt Management GmbH (Germany) \\n\\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Österreich GmbH (Austria) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Czechia s.r.o. (Czech Republic) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Polska sp.z o.o. (Poland) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Netherlands B.V. (Netherlands)\\n\\nThere were no signiﬁcant changes in the organisation dur-\\ning 2021. \\n\\nThe  share  capital  of  UBM  Development  AG  totalled \\n€22,416,540  as  of  31  December  2021  and  is  divided  into \\n7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising the IGO-Ortner \\nGroup and the Strauss Group held an unchanged 38.8% of \\nthe  shares  outstanding  at  year-end  2021.  In  addition,  the \\nIGO-Ortner  Group  held  6.8%  of  UBM  outside  the  syndi-\\ncate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a pri-\\nvate investor. Free ﬂoat comprised 49.4% of the shares and \\nincluded  the  3.9%  of  the  shares  held  by  the  Management \\nand  Supervisory  Boards.  Most  of  the  other  free  ﬂoat  was \\nheld by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%). \\n\\n2-1, 2-2, 2-9\\n\\n1.5. Teamwork, also at the top  \\n\\nCooperation  is  not  only  a  guiding  principle  for  UBM,  but \\nalso  a  quality  valued  by  top  management.  The  four-mem-\\nber Management Board – Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin \\nLöcker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO) and Martina Maly-Gärtner \\n(COO)  –  is  supported  by  the  Executive  Committee  as  an \\nextended management body.\\nThe  Executive  Committee  includes  the  four  Management \\nBoard members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-\\ntry  and  specialist  managers.  The  committee  meets  six  to \\neight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure \\ncontinuous calibration. The members of the Executive Com-\\nmittee,  in  total,  have  invested  approximately  €5m  in  UBM \\nshares and participate at 5% in an increase in the company’s \\nvalue through stock options.\\n\\nSustainability is an issue for management.  \\nBut not only. \\nThe  assignment  of  responsibilities  proves  that  sustain- \\nability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter \\nfor  management.  The  Management  Board  is  responsible \\nfor the organisation of and compliance with sustainability \\nissues.  Thomas  G.  Winkler,  the  Chief  Executive  Ofﬁcer,  is \\nin  charge  of  the  sustainability-relevant  areas  of  strategy, \\ninvestor  relations  &  ESG,  and  compliance.  Green  build-\\ning and timber construction report to Martin Löcker, while \\nPatric  Thate  makes  sure  the  ﬁnancing  turns  “green“  and \\noversees  the  implementation  of  ESG  data  management. \\nEmployees  &  work  safety  as  well  as  hotel  operations  are \\nthe  responsibility  of  Martina  Maly-Gärtner.  The  Executive \\nCommittee regularly deals with sustainability issues, espe-\\ncially  in  view  of  the  new  strategic  focus  on  green.  smart. \\nand more. \\n\\nUBM became one of the ﬁrst listed companies in Austria to \\nestablish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board in \\nFebruary 2021. As the senior controlling body, the Super-\\nvisory Board is now able to meet its responsibilities for the \\nenvironment, society and governance through a separate \\ncommittee.  The  ESG  Committee  deals  with  the  analysis \\nof sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts \\nin  corporate  processes  –  in  particular,  it  deﬁnes  the  most \\n\\n12\\n\\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##important  ESG  factors  that  are  deter-\\nmined by the company’s sector afﬁliation \\nand  business  model  and  are  subject  to \\nregional inﬂuence.\\nThe  ESG  Committee  monitors  and  sup-\\nports  activities  in  line  with  the  ESG  cat-\\nalogue  of  measures  based  on  the  clear \\nassignment  of  responsibilities  at  Man-\\nagement  Board  and  Supervisory  Board \\nlevels.  It  also  supervises  and  evaluates \\nthe implemented ESG measures – above \\nall,  the \\nimpact  of  procurement  and \\ndevelopment  processes  on  ecosystems, \\nthe use of resources, the direct and indi-\\nrect  neighbourhood,  and  good  corpo-\\nrate  management.  Additional  informa-\\ntion on the ESG Committee can be found \\nin the Annual Report for 2021 under the \\nCorporate  Governance  Report  starting \\non page 88. \\nThe  inclusion  of  ESG  factors  in  the  remu-\\nneration  model  will  be  analysed  in  detail \\nin the future: Plans call for the integration \\nof  key  ESG  performance  indicators  in \\nmanagement’s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\nFurther information on the Supervisory Board and Manage-\\nment Board is provided in the Annual Report for 2021 under \\nthe Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88. \\n\\nShared values as the basis  \\nMany projects in many different countries – that demands a \\ncommon basis to make sure everyone pulls together. At UBM, \\nthis  means  a  clear  strategic  focus  and  shared  values.

This  position  consists  primarily  of  capitalised \\nrights of use from leases, which totalled €8.8m at the end \\nof 2021. \\n\\nCurrent assets rose by €122.8m over the level at year-end \\n2020  to  €669.8m  as  of  31  December  2021.  This  increase \\nwas based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash \\nreceivables, which grew by €176.1m to €423.3m. \\n\\nEquity  totalled  €550.6m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31 \\nDecember  2020:  €482.9m)  and  was  increased  primarily \\nby the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30–35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was ﬁnalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.  Nearly  50%  of  the \\n2018  hybrid  bond  was  redeemed  prematurely,  and  this \\nﬁnancing was extended to 2026. \\n\\nBond  liabilities  totalled  €526.5m  at  the  end  of  December \\n2021 and were €70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-\\nvious  year  (31  December  2020:  €456.5m).  A  €7.0m  bearer \\nbond  (term  2021–2025)  and  a  further  €0.5m  bearer  bond \\n(term  2021–2025)  were  issued  in  the  ﬁrst  quarter  of  2021. \\nIn  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  UBM  issued  a  sustain- \\nability-linked bond (term: 2021–2026). The issue volume of \\n€150.0m included €68.9m from the exchange of the exist-\\ning  bond  2017–2022.  A  promissory  note  loan  and  bearer \\nbond (term: 2016–2021) were repaid in December 2021.\\n\\nNet  debt  was  substantially  lower  than  the  previous  year \\nat €381.0m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \\n€479.1m).  This  indicator  represents  current  and  non-cur-\\nrent  bonds  and  ﬁnancial  liabilities,  excluding  lease  liabil-\\nities,  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  decline  in  net \\ndebt  resulted,  above  all,  from  distributions  from  equity- \\naccounted  companies,  property  sales  and  an  increase  in \\nﬁnancial liabilities as support for investments.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##UBM IN DETAIL16\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##UBM IN DETAILESG – which stands for Environment, Social, Governance – is an integral part  of our strategy.

As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market. UBM shares are listed in Vienna‘s Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments ﬁts per-fectly with UBM’s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our ﬁnancing to green ﬁnancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ﬁve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond ﬁnancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the ﬁrst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ﬁve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM’s commitment to reach a speciﬁc ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green ﬁnancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green ﬁnancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit ﬁnancing represents the next step to even more green ﬁnancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for “green loans“. Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate ﬁnancing. Over the longer term, we also see “green bonds“ as attrac-tive tools for green ﬁnancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speciﬁc use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien für Europas Metropolen.

Sustainability  not only demands an ecological approach  but also socially farsighted thinking. We are working, step by step, to build  a UBM that also leads the way with  high social competence. As an employer,  we support cooperation and fairness.  As a developer, we create innovative  building concepts for generations to come.  And as a good corporate citizen, we live  our responsibility to society.UBM IN DETAIL27\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##2828The DIY developerSocial aspects are just as important for green thinking. As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our ofﬁces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM’s training and educational programmes as well as our “UBM Day”, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That’s more than all trafﬁc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Efﬁcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community “live“. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the ﬁrst time as a “green meeting“ in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements – from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering ﬁrm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the “Caritas am Himmel“ during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the “Lichtblickhof“ brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na‘s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations – and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM’s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead, €50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria’s only stationary children’s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in difﬁcult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children‘s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankeschön\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM‘s underground car park\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##3131UBM IN DETAILDay in the other UBM countries as a ﬁxed part of our schedule starting in 2022. “smart“ and “green travelling“ as education In October 2021, roughly 30 of our colleagues travelled to Berlin to learn about the realisation of smart ofﬁce building ideas on site and, above all, to also experience the UBM community outside the ofﬁce. A number of colleagues involved with UBM’s “green“ strategy took a trip to the Austrian province of Vorarl-berg at the same time, where they reviewed model pro-jects and workshops for timber construction. The participants in both trips gained new impressions and valuable impulses for their future work and for cooperation throughout the UBM Group.

In addition to the environment and  social issues, good governance has come  to play a greater role in the perception  and valuation of companies. UBM recognised  this long ago and has also ﬁrmly anchored  good corporate management at the ESG level.UBM IN DETAIL33\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##U B M   I N   D E T A I L\\n\\nGood ratings.\\nGreat opportunities.\\n\\nA number of inﬂuential players have established a position \\nas intermediaries between ESG requirements and the cap-\\nital  market.  In  addition  to  shareholders  and  banks,  rating \\nagencies,  analysts  and  international  institutional  investors \\nare becoming more and more important. One key example \\nis  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI),  which  has  deﬁned \\nbinding  global  guidelines  for  the  preparation  of  sustain-\\nability  reports.  UBM,  as  an  international  company,  already \\nreports in accordance with the latest GRI standards to pro-\\nvide  decision-makers  with  comparable  information  and \\nunderstandable performance indicators. \\n\\nClear criteria and responsibilities \\nThe  ESG  Committee  has  wide-ranging  responsibilities.  It \\nanalyses sustainability criteria and corporate social respon-\\nsibility  concepts  in  corporate  processes  and  deﬁnes  the \\nmost  important  ESG  factors  based  on  industry  afﬁliation, \\nbusiness  model  and  regional  inﬂuences.  The  committee \\nalso  clariﬁes  responsibilities  at  Management  Board  and \\nSupervisory Board levels. It monitors and evaluates the ESG \\nmeasures  set  by  UBM  –  and,  for  example,  regularly  exam-\\nines and documents the effects of employment and devel-\\nopment processes.\\n\\nAn ESG Committee at the highest level\\nESG  issues  deserve  the  greatest  possible  attention.  At \\nUBM, that means they are an issue for the boss. For exam-\\nple: the ESG reporting by the UBM Management Board to \\nthe  Supervisory  Board  goes  far  beyond  standard  informa-\\ntion. An ESG Committee was established especially for this \\npurpose  and  is  comparable  to  the  Audit  Committee  that \\nreviews UBM’s ﬁnancial reporting.\\n\\nThe integrity of our customers is regularly reviewed with a \\nso-called “KYC (Know Your Customer) check“. Routine train-\\ning courses are also held on the prevention of money laun-\\ndering.  “Compliance“  –  in  other  words,  the  observance  of \\nlegally required standards, especially on the capital market \\n– is given great attention.

Our strategy \\n\\nProtecting  the  future  viability  of  our  planet  is  one  of  the \\nmost important social responsibilities of our time. With the \\nannouncement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-\\nscored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral \\ncontinent in the world by 2050. Other megatrends apart from \\necology are urbanisation and the demographic and social \\nshifts in the social order. “Silver Society“ describes the age-\\ning of society, in which health and the quality of life will be \\ndeeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. \\nChanging gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes \\nhave also led to radical changes in society and the business \\nsector. These developments, together with COVID-19, are the \\ndecisive factors for the megatrend “New Work” – meaning \\npeople’s needs as regards their working world.\\n\\nWe see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an \\nopportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor \\nfor  our  entrepreneurial  actions.  In  the  sense  of  ecological \\nsustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-\\nber  construction  developers  in  Europe.  Our  actions  today \\nare already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-\\nible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s \\nusers. As  a  real  estate  developer,  we  can  give  the  office  a \\nnew  standing  as  a  communication  and  collaboration  plat-\\nform  –  the  physical  workplace  then  becomes  a  place  for \\ncommunity and corporate culture. As an employer, we also \\ntake  advantage  of  these  opportunities  –  for  example,  by  \\nbenefitting from the additional innovation potential created \\nby a diverse workforce. \\n\\nUBM  has  anchored  the  relevance  of  ESG  in  its  corporate \\nstrategy through the focus on green. smart. and more. and is \\nintroducing concrete measures. The efficient use of resources \\nis an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues \\nand adherence to compliance rules. UBM’s flagship projects, \\ngreen building certifications and the activities evolving from \\nthe green. smart. and more. strategy reflect the requirements \\nof the EU and create new opportunities for UBM.\\n\\ngreen. stands for measures in support of greening, meaning \\nthe redirection of the economy in line with the environment. \\nOur primary focus is on timber construction as well as renew-\\nable energies and green building certification.\\n\\nsmart.  expresses  our  commitment  to  intelligent  buildings. \\nWith the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be \\nadapted to meet the needs of users and, at the same time, \\noperations can be made more efficient.\\n\\nand  more.  means  we  tell  stories  with  our  buildings.  This \\ninvolves aesthetics, well-being and customer experience – a \\n“more“ that is perceptible all over.\\n\\nOur  sustainability  activities  are  based  on  the  applicable \\nrules and regulations in the countries where we are active. \\nFor example: government programmes in the countries rel-\\nevant for UBM cover issues like the expansion of renewable \\nenergy, the efficient use of energy, subsidy programmes for \\nenvironmentally  friendly  behaviour  and  the  strengthening \\nof fundamental and human rights, especially in the supply \\nchain. An additional framework is provided by national and \\nsupranational norms and standards, including the UN Global \\nCompact,  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the  EU \\nGreen Deal and the EU Taxonomy.

Management \\nBoard members Martin Löcker and Patric Thate also receive \\na variable performance bonus in line with the above scheme, \\nbut each up to a maximal of €240,000.00 gross per year. In \\naccordance with the remuneration policy approved by the \\nAnnual General Meeting of UBM Development AG on 28 May \\n2020, the following additional performance bonuses were \\napproved for the 2021 financial year: Martin Löcker received \\n€20,000.00 for the realisation of the Timber Pioneer project \\nin Frankfurt and Patric Thate received €40,000.00 for activ-\\nities connected with the sustainability-linked bond. Annual \\npayments are made to a pension fund for individual Man-\\nagement Board members. The amount of the contribution \\nis  based  on  the  member’s  age  and  length  of  service  with \\nthe company. D&O liability insurance has been contracted to \\ncover the members of the Management Board, whereby the \\ncosts are carried by the company. Furthermore, UBM intro-\\nduced a stock option programme for key managers and the \\nManagement Board in 2017.\\n\\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for the follow-\\ning duties in connection with the current remuneration policy \\nand in accordance with applicable legal regulations: (i) mat-\\nters related to the remuneration of the Management Board \\nmembers and the content of the employment contracts with \\nthese persons, in particular, the definition and implementa-\\ntion of the underlying principles for the remuneration of the \\nManagement Board members and the criteria for the variable \\nremuneration components in line with Rules 27 (above all, \\nthe  preparation  of  a  catalogue  for  the  variable  remunera-\\ntion components), 27a and 28 of the Austrian Code of Cor-\\nporate Governance; (ii) evaluating the remuneration policy \\nfor  the  Management  Board  members  at  regular  intervals; \\n(iii) approving the assumption of side-line activities by the \\nManagement Board members. The Remuneration Committee \\nheld two meetings during the reporting year. Consultations \\nat the meeting on 26 March 2021 included the determination \\nof the annual bonus for the members of the Management \\n\\nBoard. At the meeting on 24 June 2021, the granting of a \\nspecial bonus to Management Board members Patric Thate \\nand Martin Löcker was discussed. The members of the Remu-\\nneration Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), \\nIris Ortner and Susanne Weiss (remuneration expert).\\n\\nEach  Supervisory  Board  member  receives  an  annual  pay-\\nment  for  his  or  her  services  as  well  as  reimbursement  of \\nexpenses  and  an  attendance  fee  for  each  meeting.  The \\namount of the attendance fee and the annual payment are \\ndetermined by the Annual General Meeting. A resolution by \\nthe  Annual  General  Meeting  on  29  May  2019  established \\nthe following remuneration for members of the Supervisory \\nBoard: the chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed \\nremuneration of €50,000.00 per year, the deputy chairman \\nof the Supervisory Board fixed remuneration of €40,000.00 \\nper  year  and  the  other  members  fixed  remuneration  of \\n€30,000.00 per year.

Gross  risks  were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n \\x1f Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer & training and education\\n \\x1f Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of “double materiality“, meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company’s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM’s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe  major  issues  for  UBM  were  redefined  in  2021  as  part \\nof  a  materiality  analysis  based  on  these  three  dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n \\x1f UBM’s impact on people, society and the environment \\n \\x1f The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n \\x1f The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM’s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\n47\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE## \\x1f “Water consumption“ and “waste“ were combined \\n\\nunder “water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations“. \\n\\n \\x1f The new issue “sustainable procurement and regional \\n\\nadded value“ covers “social criteria in the supply chain“, \\n“ecological criteria in the supply chain“ and “regional \\neconomy & society“. \\n\\n \\x1f “Infrastructure and mobility“, which was previously \\n\\nincluded under “socio-cultural environment of projects“, \\nwas recorded separately.\\n\\n \\x1f The former issue “cooperations“ is still an integral part \\nof UBM’s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2\\n\\nThe results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading.

Conscious handling of risks and  \\n\\ntheir effects\\n\\nThe  realistic  assessment  and  management  of  risks  repre-\\nsent an essential factor for business success and sustainable \\nmanagement.  One  related  step  was  the  announcement  in \\n2021 of UBM’s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.).  The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM’s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart.  and  more.  corporate  strategy.  Given  the  substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings  (according  to  the  respective  national  definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\n57\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir  activities  on  the  environment.  Economic  success  and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success – and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn  the  course  of  general  risk  management,  the  probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM’s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM  has  defined  measures  and  indicators  for  assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance. The main goals are described on page \\n39, the details on page 50.

ESG reporting\\n\\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-\\ntrian  Sustainability  and  Diversity  Improvement Act  but  has \\nvoluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in \\nline with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, \\nthe company is very well prepared to address the information \\nrequirements  at  the  product  and  corporate  levels  that  will \\nresult from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. \\n\\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing \\nregulatory developments – for example, the materiality analy-\\nsis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-\\nover, UBM’s reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and \\nnorms  like  the  UN  Global  Compact  (see  section  3.9.). This \\nESG  report  serves  as  a  progress  report  for  the  UN  Global \\nCompact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD \\nrecommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this \\nreport for the first time (see section 3.6.).\\n\\nIn  connection  with  the  concrete,  measurable  goals  for  the \\ncoming  years  which  were  set  in  2021,  the  ESG  report  is  a \\nvaluable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-\\nity  to  society.  The  ESG  report  describes  the  management \\napproaches, goals and measures related to the environment, \\nsociety and governance, and highlights successes as well as \\nchallenges. The  subject  areas  are  based  on  the  materiality \\nanalysis carried out in 2021. The ESG report is prepared by \\nthe investor relations & ESG department in coordination with \\nthe specialist departments and released by the Management \\nBoard. Additional  information  on  UBM,  its  business  devel-\\nopment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 \\nannual report.\\n\\nTransparency  and  reliability  are  also  decisive  for  our  ESG \\nreporting,  and  we  therefore  arranged  for  an  external  lim-\\nited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is \\nprovided on page 125). UBM also introduced a central data \\nmanagement  tool  in  2021  which  will  be  successively  filled \\nstarting  in  2022. The  goal  is  to  create  an  informative  basis \\nfor the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. \\nControlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while \\ndata  collection  takes  place  directly  in  the  respective  areas \\nand departments in the individual countries.

UBM  has \\noffice space at 19 locations. Our goal in this area is to steadily \\nreduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach \\nthis goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-\\ntion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-\\nagement are also important issues for UBM and are internally \\nmanaged and reported. \\n\\nFewer standing assets\\nThe  strategic  focus  of  UBM’s  business  activities  includes \\nthe  development  and  sale  of  properties.  Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties – here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\n67\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT \\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##4.1.  Energy efficiency, renewable energies & \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n4.1.1. Importance of the issue \\nWith  the  Paris  Agreement,  nations  across  the  world  have \\nagreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially \\nbelow 2°C and, through further measures, to limit the increase \\nto 1.5°C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent \\nby  2050.  Related  activities  include  the  European  Commis-\\nsion‘s “Fit for 55“ package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n– including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers – are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole – reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI  3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials,  energy-efficient  building  design,  and  the  use  of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction  is  responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction  and  operation  of  a  building  can  be  reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop “smart“ buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360° principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the “Next Level“ efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics – as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360° process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable  –  and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset  a  goal  as  part  of  its  strategic  reorientation  to  achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class – at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.  Our  business  partners \\nare required to meet the same high standards, for example \\nstrict environmental requirements for suppliers’ production \\nprocesses and building material components. Environmental \\nprotection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement \\n(further information can be found in section 6).\\n\\nThe focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations \\nis  also  increasing.  The  corporate  units  in  Austria  (AG  and \\nUBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified \\nunder  the  international  environmental  management  norm  \\nISO  14001  and  quality  management  norm  ISO  9001,  and \\nUBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022.

The  use  of  timber  as  a  building  material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.

We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin  2022.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360° principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM  underscored  its  commitment  to  sustainable  building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe  positive  experience  from  this Vienna  project  was  also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction.  This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the “embodied carbon”, \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics \\non  the  timber  market  were  a  further  source  of  uncertainty \\nduring the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber \\nprice stabilised at a level where this raw material is available \\nat a reasonable price. \\n\\nEnergy & CO2 intensity\\n \\x1f Reduction of primary energy requirements to national \\n\\nnearly zero energy building standards by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\\n \\x1f Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy \\n\\ncarriers to 50% by 2030\\n\\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined \\nthe primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-\\nning of technical building equipment in all new development \\nprojects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-\\ntems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-\\ntion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or \\nequipment.\\n\\nThe durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-\\nond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: \\nThe specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life \\nCycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle \\nAssessments  (LCA/lifecycle  evaluations).

Green \\nbuilding  certification  for  all  new  projects  is  a  mandatory \\nelement of the 360° principle. In addition, the profiles “dis- \\nmantling“ and “construction site“ were added to the certifica-\\ntion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project \\nin  Vienna.  UBM  has  decided  to  extend  its  certifications  to \\nrefurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call \\nfor the continuation of this strategy.

Rail  travel  must  be  given  preference \\nfor shorter distances, and video conference portals should be \\nused more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group’s commu-\\nnity “live”. This event was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith  a  long  list  of  requirements  including  environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM’s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group’s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM  has  carried  out  regular  energy  audits  since  2016  in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001. ISO 50001 audits are scheduled for \\nGermany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will \\nfollow.\\n\\nAn important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will \\nbe expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more \\nexact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-\\nsions.

Our focus on struc-\\ntural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their \\ndurability and their recycling capability.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  anchors,  among  others,  the  transition \\nto a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-\\nstruction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits  through  prefabrication  and  modular  construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe  production  of  steel  and  concrete,  in  particular,  is  CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.  Later  recycling  capacity  can  be \\nactively included as early as the planning stage, for example \\n\\n74\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions  over the \\nentire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping \\nwith the focus on sustainability.  GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n4.3.  Ground sealing, climate change  \\nadjustments and biodiversity \\n\\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the \\nlocal fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate – local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands) – and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM’s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough  the  avoidance  of  inseparable  composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled – untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n \\x1f Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n \\x1f Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe  planning  stage  for  all  UBM  projects  must  include  and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall,  for  building  sections  with  massive  components  as  well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare  separated  mechanically  at  the  site,  and  high  priority  is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall  materials  resulting  from  demolition  can  be  reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded “Gold“ \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##UBM’s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource “land”, \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern. It will be reflected in future projects through roof-\\ntops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and \\nfacade greening – which will help to reduce the heat island \\neffect in our urban areas as well as the heating and cooling \\nload.\\n\\nUBM’s focal points for biodiversity are as follows:\\n\\n \\x1f Brownfield developments\\n \\x1f Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities\\n \\x1f Increase in biological diversity through roof and  \\n\\nfacade greening \\n\\n \\x1f Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening\\n\\nGoal from our sustainability programme:\\n\\nBrownfield  \\ndevelopment\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nBrownfield development\\n \\x1f Increase share of brownfield developments  \\n\\nin new projects to over 66% by 2025\\n\\nAs mentioned above, UBM’s acquisition process is focused \\non brownfield developments (land with existing buildings). \\nBiodiversity has been integrated in UBM‘s 360° process land-\\nscape.

In \\ncomparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-\\ntion,  the  conversion  and  vitalisation  of  existing  buildings \\nresults  in  lower  energy  consumption  and  lower  CO2  emis-\\nsions – an important ecological aspect that will also be taken \\ninto account in the future. Other resource-conserving benefits \\ninclude the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new \\nsoil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and \\n\\nthe preservation of existing building substance.

The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.

Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith  the Austrian  Ecolabel  criteria,  specific  measures  were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure  Katowice  Centrum:  Its  18-metre-high  and  260  m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the “green and clean“ motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##80\\n\\n81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

In this connection, we have defined the follow-\\ning focus areas:\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer and training & education \\n \\x1f Diversity and equal opportunities\\n \\x1f Health and occupational safety\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local \\ncommunities  and  neighbouring  residents.  Our  projects \\ncontribute  to  the  quality  of  life  for  society. This  applies,  in \\nparticular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true \\nfor residential construction and office buildings. We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n \\x1f Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n \\x1f Infrastructure & mobility\\n \\x1f Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company’s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study “The State of Skills 2021“ shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems  at  several  levels  over  the  long  term.  Employees \\nwith  insufficient  expertise  will  be  unable  to  carry  out  their \\nactivities at a higher quality level – and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments  take  longer,  and  both  quality  and  motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nauthorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. \\nWe encourage our employees to be proactive through short \\ndecision paths and flat hierarchies.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities  can  lead  to  lower  employee  motivation  and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust  respect  human  rights,  reject  child  labour  and  forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive  working  conditions  can  damage  a  company’s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers  in  online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company’s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM’s success.

Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas  well  as  a  green  inner  courtyard  and  roof  terrace  with  a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created “new work zones“ serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur  Group-wide  UBM  Day,  which  is  held  every  two  years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders. In addi-\\ntion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise \\nevents like barista workshops and joint participation in sport \\nevents to promote teambuilding.\\n\\nWork-life balance\\nWe believe it is important to help our employees establish \\na healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and \\nfamily  life.  Individual  working  time  models  are  part  of  our \\nefforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the \\ncompany agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family \\nmembers.

Innovation potential is also lost when the \\npersonal  backgrounds  of  employees  (e.g.  migration  back-\\nground, nationality, family constellations) are ignored. \\n\\nThe lack of equal opportunities at the workplace (remunera-\\ntion etc.) can lead to lower employee motivation and higher \\nturnover, which means additional costs and time for new hir-\\ning.  Moreover,  there  are  signs  that  the  legal  requirements \\ngoverning equal opportunities will be strengthened in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nFair  treatment  of  our  employees  and  a  culture  of  mutual \\nrespect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all \\nemployees equally – regardless of their ethnic, national or \\nsocial background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or \\nreligious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic \\nor other standing.

Health and safety\\n\\nWork absences can result in financial damages, the loss of \\nknow-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health \\nand injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-\\nical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-\\nistent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased \\nsickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are \\nassociated with health and injury risks, among others through \\nsevere or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-\\native effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-\\nistrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal \\nconsequences for the employer. \\n\\nOur  business  success  is  based  to  a  significant  degree  on \\nthe  commitment  and  motivation  of  our  employees.  As  an \\nemployer,  we  also  feel  responsible  for  their  physical  and \\npsychological health. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n \\x1f Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level – \\n\\ngoal: zero work accidents \\n\\n \\x1f Protect and promote employees‘ health\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, support for employees’ physical \\nand psychological health in everyday office routines plays a \\ncentral role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-\\npational  physician,  in-house  fitness  rooms).  A  major  focal \\npoint  for  construction  sites  involves  occupational  safety \\nmeasures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection \\nincluding training).\\n\\nUBM has implemented an integrated management system to \\nsupport occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-\\nees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe  success  of  these  measures  is  reflected  in  the  number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees’ health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms. Outdoor athletes can join the “UBM-Express” and \\ntake part in various running events. An occupational physi-\\ncian is also available to assist employees at UBM’s Vienna \\nlocation.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today’s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur  many  years  of  experience  as  a  real  estate  developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus,  that  means  designing  projects  to  minimise  the  poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and ÖGNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Accessibility\\n \\x1f Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n \\x1f Indoor climate and acoustics\\n \\x1f Security \\n \\x1f Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification  –  through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends – as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.

Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept – for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas  well  as  sustainable  mobility  concepts  (car/bike  sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality  of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation. The following offering is \\ndesigned to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-\\ntally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-\\ning users:\\n\\n \\x1f E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for \\n\\ne-bike batteries \\n\\n \\x1f Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle\\n \\x1f E-bike hire stations\\n \\x1f Additional bicycle storage areas\\n \\x1f Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers \\nand changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair \\npoint \\n\\nSome  of  these  services,  for  example  car  sharing  and  the \\ne-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in \\nthe neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower – which creates excellent and \\nefficient synergies for both buildings.\\n\\nAt the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be \\nable to use e-charging stations in the office and residential \\nareas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing \\nproducts.   \\n\\nThe Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, \\nis  currently  carrying  out  a  “manage  to  green“  project  that \\ninvolves  the  refitting  of  two  buildings  to  include  parking \\nspaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, \\ne-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking \\nspaces in the business park.   GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n5.6.  Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness  of  sustainability  issues  can  also  improve  users’  sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM  wants  to  create  attractive  quarters  that  contribute  to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##The  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM’s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens‘ initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nHöfe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject  –  and  for  all  other  UBM  developments  –  is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city’s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens’ concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone – an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n– is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill  generate  energy  on  site  with  wells  and  depth  probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject.  In  addition  to  shared  spaces,  shared  mobility  and \\nshared  activities,  the  use  of  a  quarter  management  app  is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases  and  improves  the  value  of  the  area  surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation  of  its  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

Corporate governance & compliance \\n\\n6.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial  benefits and can help to improve the quality of  life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand,  on  the  other  hand,  criminal  prosecution  is  becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties  and  civil  claims  by  damaged  parties.  In  many  cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany’s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years – also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard (“Sustainable Corporate Governance“) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.

The high demands we set for \\nourselves also apply to our business partners and employees. \\nUBM’s business model is oriented on ecological, social and \\nethically  correct  business  practices.  In  order  to  strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural \\nrequirements.\\n\\nUBM’s  focus  markets  are  strictly  regulated  and  controlled \\nlegal areas with high human rights standards. Nonetheless, \\nviolations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and \\nrespect  for  human  rights  is  therefore  anchored  in  internal \\nguidelines. We are committed to the ten principles of the UN \\nGlobal  Compact  which,  for  example,  prohibit  child  labour \\nand  forced  labour.  Our  codes  of  conduct  (ethic  code  and \\ncode of conduct for business partners) require guarantees \\nfor  fair  compensation,  workplace  safety,  support  for  equal \\nopportunity and the freedom of association, for example.\\n\\nOur responsible and transparent management is based on \\nthe following cornerstones:\\n\\nAustrian Code of Corporate Governance\\nUBM,  as  an  international  listed  company,  has  pledged  its \\ncommitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a \\nvoluntary guideline for good management and control.

More specifically: As part of the “Next Level“ efficiency \\nprogramme, all core and support processes for project devel-\\nopment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates \\nand  ultimately  defined  for  the  entire  company.  Roles  and \\nresponsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and \\nthe control mechanisms were revised and improved. These \\nprocedures  and  rules  give  employees  the  corresponding \\ntools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design \\nof processes and controls. \\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##We  are  convinced  that  these  types  of  work  instructions, \\nguidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-\\nmunication and documentation, and help to make processes \\nmore efficient. They also make effective controls possible.\\n\\nUBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-\\nance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and \\nto quickly identify and correct any weak points in business \\nand organisational processes, on the other hand.\\n\\n6.1.3. Organisational structure  \\nCompliance  management  at  UBM  is  installed  in  the  legal, \\ncorporate and compliance department, which is also respon-\\nsible for the content of the related guidelines. A compliance \\nofficer  and  deputy  were  appointed  by  the  Management \\nBoard of UBM AG. The compliance guidelines are prepared \\nby the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-\\nment Board and communicated to all employees. All UBM \\nemployees have digital access to these guidelines. \\n\\nThe internal control system and internal audit \\nOur  internal  control  system  (ICS)  is  an  integral  part  of  our \\nbusiness processes. The most important goals of this control \\nsystem are to:\\n\\n \\x1f Monitor compliance with business policies  \\n\\nand defined goals\\n\\n \\x1f Safeguard the company’s assets \\n \\x1f Guarantee the reliability of accounting and reporting\\n \\x1f Maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of  \\n\\nbusiness processes\\n\\n \\x1f Identify risks at an early point in time\\n \\x1f Reliably assess potential risks\\n \\x1f Monitor compliance with legal requirements\\n \\x1f Ensure the efficient use of resources and cost savings \\n\\nIn addition to the controls in core processes, UBM has installed \\ncommercial and technical controlling functions. Both report \\ndirectly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling \\nmonitors the ongoing development of business to identify \\ndeviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes \\ncertain  management  receives  the  necessary  information. \\nTechnical  controlling  monitors  project  development  with \\na focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-\\ngress and all processes important for technical realisation.  \\nGRI  2-15, 2-23, 2-25, 2-26, 3-3, 205-2, 407-1\\n\\nThe compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines \\nand is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes \\nin legal regulations. The compliance guidelines are reviewed \\nannually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and \\ninternal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of \\nthe compliance management system. \\n\\nThe key positions in the internal data protection organisation \\nare the data protection coordinator and one data protection \\nofficer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-\\nment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-\\nlation of a data breach response team for the management \\nand reporting of data protection violations in agreement with \\nthe data protection guideline.\\n\\nA  money  laundering  officer  has  also  been  appointed.  As \\npart of KYC reviews (“know your customer“), he compares \\nthe data received with sanction lists, entries in the register \\nof economic owners, etc. Additional information on the KYC \\nreviews can be found on page 100.\\n\\nThe respective organisational units implement the individual \\ninternal guidelines and work instructions.

We have implemented the following measures to support \\nthis approach and anchor these principles in our company.\\n\\nThere were no confirmed cases of corruption, proven money \\nlaundering incidents or other violations of rules and regu-\\nlations that would have led to fines or non-monetary sanc-\\ntions in 2021 or 2020. Furthermore, there were no confirmed \\ncases where contracts with business partners were cancelled \\nor not extended due to violations involving corruption, and \\nno confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of \\nemployees due to corruption. There were no proceedings \\nfor anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-\\nination incidents.  \\n\\nWhistleblower system\\nThe whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover \\nviolations  of  data  protection  regulations  and  other  report-\\nable incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. \\nIt will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports \\nin connection with UBM‘s ethics code and made available in \\nCzech and Polish.\\n\\nQuality management system\\nISO  9001  certification  is  intended  to  make  sure  the  pro-\\ncess-oriented quality management system is based on the \\nhighest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG \\nand UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-\\ntified  under  the  international  quality  management  norm  \\nISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-\\ntification covered 62% of UBM’s workforce in 2021.\\n\\nRemuneration model\\nThe possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model \\nwill be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in \\nmanagement‘s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\n\\nImplement guidelines and prevent misconduct by \\nconsequent preventive activities\\nEmployee training  \\nThe goal of training is to create a greater awareness among \\nemployees  for  potential  sources  of  risk  and,  in  this  way, \\nprevent  corruption  and  anti-competitive  behaviour.  New \\nemployees  receive  training  from  the  compliance  depart-\\nment  immediately  after  they  join  UBM.  Regular  e-learning \\nprogrammes cover compliance with guidelines on different \\nsubjects  like  the  anti-corruption  guideline  and  the  guide-\\nline on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to \\nensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, \\nand the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-\\npliance guideline to prevent market abuse.\\n\\nMost  of  the  classroom  training  on  compliance  regulations \\nhas been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 \\ndue  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. A  total  of  174  employee \\ntraining courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance \\nissues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money \\nlaundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were \\n\\n99\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##reworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case \\nexamples.  \\n\\nThe compliance team frequently visits training courses, and \\nthere are additional certifications for selected responsibilities \\n(for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified \\nas a compliance officer under ISO 19600).\\n\\nThe  procedure  for  the  distribution  of  relevant  corporate \\nguidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-\\nees  will  be  notified  separately  of  any  relevant  changes  in \\nexisting guidelines.\\n\\nEthics code\\nThe ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees \\nin their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet \\nour sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-\\ngration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, \\nthe focus on human rights and environmental protection was \\nreinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG \\nis also supported by company events and training (like the \\nClimate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the \\ngreen. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal \\ncommunication.\\n\\nSampling controls of insider information\\nThe compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-\\nitor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider \\ninformation and confidential and price-sensitive information. \\nAdditional clarification briefings are held if necessary.\\n\\nPrevent money laundering and terrorism financing\\nKYC review of new business partners\\nKnow your customer is one of the basic principles underly-\\ning the guideline for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing and the work instructions on money \\nlaundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries  and  contracts  with  politically  exposed  persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities. The related activities are classified \\ninternationally as having an increased risk of money launder-\\ning, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated \\nregularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing. \\n\\nThe  risk  analysis  for  all  Austrian  subsidiaries  which  have \\nregistered  brokerage  as  one  of  their  commercial  activities \\nwas updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the \\nrespective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement &  \\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream  supply  chain  (raw  materials  extraction,  materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM’s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays “Think global, order local“. Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM‘s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the  one hand, local  companies are  supported  and,  on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving  timber  construction.  UBM  created  jobs  and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM‘s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-\\nscored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification \\nof  most  of  our  commercial  projects  –  including  residential \\nconstruction in the future – based on recognised sustainability \\nseals like DNGB, ÖGNI, LEED or BREEAM.\\n\\nThe green. smart. and more. initiative\\nIn  line  with  the  above-mentioned  management  approach, \\nthe green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. \\nIt is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that \\ncovered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The \\nfocus was placed on the following seven core issues which \\nwere defined in a dialogue between the Management Board \\nand Executive Committee:\\n\\nThese certifications also involve external experts and auditors \\nto confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. \\nMinimising the environmental impact of a building during its \\nentire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating \\nenergy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning \\nstage. The economic dimension covers the construction costs \\nas well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire \\nusage period or lifetime of the building.

Innovation & technologies  \\n\\nInternal and external research activities and innovations for \\nsustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value \\nchain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are \\nconsidered. The use of smart building technology (e.g. sen-\\nsors for smart ventilation, intelligent shading), for example, \\ncan make an important contribution to energy savings and \\nefficiency improvements and, in this way, reduce the negative \\nimpact  on  people  and  the  environment. An  urban  quarter \\nthat incorporates social aspects, e.g. communication areas, \\ninteractive commercial areas (co-working spaces, etc.) con-\\ntributes to the social structure and interaction in the quarter.\\n\\nsmart. is UBM’s keyword above all for new optimisation and \\ncontrol technologies as well as digitalisation. These activities \\nare focused on the following:\\n\\nIdeas and concepts were developed for these core areas as \\nanswers to the challenges created by climate change. The \\nprevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building \\nmaterials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-\\ngration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-\\nwords.

It provides information on the 2021 financial year of \\nUBM Development AG.\\n\\nUBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which \\nwas based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards  “Core \\nOption“.\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with § 267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-\\nentation of information from previous reports is documented \\nin the footnotes beginning on page 112.

These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-\\npendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a \\nlimited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.  \\n\\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract \\n(AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors (https://www.ksw.or.at/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-\\n209/), which also apply towards third parties. As provided under section 275 para. 2 UGB (liability provision regarding the \\naudit of financial statements of small and medium-sized companies), our responsibility and liability towards the Company \\nand any third parties arising from the assurance engagement are limited to a total of EUR 2 million. \\n\\n125\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a \\nreasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is sub-\\nstantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. \\n\\nThe selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following: \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the overall presentation of the disclosures and non-financial information\\n \\x1f Critical assessment of the Company’s analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders by inter-\\n\\nviewing the responsible employees and inspecting relevant documents \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including the due diligence processes implemented \\nas well as the processes used to ensure an accurate presentation in the ESG report by interviewing the Company’s \\nmanagement and inspecting internal guidelines, procedural instructions and management systems in connection with \\nnon-financial matters/disclosures \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an understanding of reporting processes by interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected docu-\\n\\nmentations \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indica-\\ntors, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations. All interviews as well as procedures \\nwere performed by virtual means due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the coronavirus containment measures\\n\\n \\x1f Examining the ESG report regarding its completeness in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of \\n\\nthe GRI Standards 2021\\n\\nThe following is not part of our engagement:\\n\\n \\x1f Examining the processes and internal controls particularly regarding their design, implementation and effectiveness \\n \\x1f Performing procedures at individual locations as well as measurements or individual evaluations to check the reliability \\n\\nand accuracy of data received \\n\\n \\x1f Examining the prior-year figures, forward-looking information or data from external surveys \\n \\x1f Examining the correct transfer of data and references from the (consolidated) financial statements to the non-financial \\n\\nreporting; and \\n\\n \\x1f Examining the information and disclosures on the website or further references on the internet\\n\\nNeither an audit nor a review of financial statements is objective of our engagement. Furthermore, neither the disclosure \\nand solution of criminal acts, as e.g. embezzlement or other kinds of fraud, and wrongful doings, nor the assessment of the \\neffectiveness and profitability of the management are the objectives of our engagement.\\n\\n126\\n\\n127\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##Restriction of Use\\nBecause our report is prepared solely for and on behalf of the client, it does not constitute a basis for any reliance on is con-\\ntents by other third parties. Therefore, no claims of other third parties can be derived from it.\\n\\nConclusion\\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe \\nthat the Company’s ESG Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of section 267a \\nUGB and of the GRI Standards 2021.\\n\\nVienna \\nApril 6, 2022\\n\\nPwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH \\n\\nMarius Richter  \\nAustrian Certified Public Accountant\\n\\n127\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##Contact\\n\\nChristoph Rainer\\nTel: +43 (0) 664 80 1873 200\\nesg@ubm-development.com\\n\\nImprint\\n\\nMedia Proprietor and Publisher\\nUBM Development AG\\nLaaer-Berg-Strasse 43,  \\n1100 Vienna, Austria\\nTel: +43 (0) 50 1873 100\\nwww.ubm-development.com\\n\\nConcept, Design and Editing\\nUBM Development AG\\n\\nCreated with ns.publish, a product of \\nMultimedia Solutions AG, Zurich\\n\\nImage Section\\nCreative Director: Christine Eisl\\nEditing: Tobias Sckaer, Hans Fleißner\\nProduction: Michael Schmid\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nPhotography\\nPhilipp Horak\\nAstrid Knie\\nunsplash.com\\nUBM Development\\nKlaus Vyhnalek\\nCraig Dillon \\ngettyimages.com\\n\\nRenderings\\nbloomimages.com\\n\\nPictograms\\nflaticon.com\\n\\nPrinting\\nGerin Druck GmbH\\nGerinstraße 1–3, 2120 Wolkersdorf, Austria\\n\\nTranslation\\nDonna Schiller-Margolis\\n\\nThis  ESG  report  includes  forward-looking  statements  which  are  based  on  current  assumptions  and  estimates  made  to  the  best  of  their \\n\\nknowledge  by  the  management  of  UBM  Development  AG.  These  forward-looking  statements  can  be  identified  by  words  like  “expecta-\\n\\ntion“,  “goal“  or  similar  terms  and  expressions.  Forward-looking  statements,  by  definition,  include  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  forecasts  con-\\n\\ncerning  the  future  development  of  the  company  represent  estimates  which  are  based  on  the  information  available  at  the  time  the  annual \\n\\nreport  was  prepared.  If  the  assumptions  underlying  these  forecasts  do  not  materialise  or  if  unexpected  risks  occur  at  an  amount  not  quan-\\n\\ntified  or  quantifiable,  the  actual  future  development  and  actual  future  results  can  differ  from  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  forecasts. \\n\\nSignificant  factors  for  these  types  of  deviations  can  include,  for  example,  changes  in  the  general  economic  environment  or  the  legal  and  reg-\\n\\nulatory  framework  in  Austria  and  the  EU  as  well  as  changes  in  the  real  estate  sector.  UBM  Development  AG  will  not  guarantee  or  assume  any \\n\\nliability  for  the  agreement  of  future  development  and  future  results  with  the  estimates  and  assumptions  made  in  this  ESG  report.  UBM \\n\\nDevelopment  AG  will  not  update  these  forward-looking  statements  to  reflect  actual  events  or  changes  in  assumptions  and  expectations. \\n\\nThe ESG report as of 31 December 2021 was prepared with the greatest possible care to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information in all sec-\\n\\ntions. The amounts were rounded based on the compensated summation method. However, rounding, typesetting and printing errors cannot be excluded. \\n\\nThis ESG report is published in English and German and is available in both languages on the website of UBM Development AG. In the event of a \\n\\ndiscrepancy or deviation, the German language version takes precedence.\\n\\nThis ESG report was printed on Olin regular absolute white, an FSC-certified paper that meets the highest demands for environmental compatibility.\\n\\n202122019\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##\\x0c##END_OF_PAGE##1.4.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GrtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signicance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG  it stands for the S in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed   just underscored  the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBMs green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reected in the focus on green building, green nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signicance of ESG for UBM  also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c ',\n",

UBM shares are listed in Viennas Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments ts per-fectly with UBMs strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our nancing to green nancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBMs commitment to reach a specic ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit nancing represents the next step to even more green nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for green loans. Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate nancing. Over the longer term, we also see green bonds as attrac-tive tools for green nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a specic use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien fr Europas Metropolen.

That begins in our ofces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBMs training and educational programmes as well as our UBM Day, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. Thats more than all trafc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Efcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community live. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the rst time as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements  from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the Caritas am Himmel during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the Lichtblickhof brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-nas Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations  and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBMs underground car park.
