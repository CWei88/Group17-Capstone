"Maly-GrtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria."
"In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signicance of ESG."
But really?
"As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the rst refugees from Ukraine."
"That is also ESG it stands for the S in Environment, Social and , this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets."
"Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation."
That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.
In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed just underscored the importance of ESG.
ESG is an integral part of UBMs green.
"That is also reected in the focus on green building, green nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles."
"With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions."
Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conrm our commitment to ESG.
And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions.
"Our ESG report will be audited for the rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report."
U B M A T A G L A N C E Our strategy can be summarised in four words: green.
That shows just how important sustainability is for UBM.
It represents the focal point of all our actions.
"This report explains the various aspects of sustainability in connection with the Environment, Social and Governance."
U B M A T A G L A N C E 1.
U B M A T A G L A N C E green.
Our business model.
Explained in brief.
That summarises the strategy of UBM Development AG in four words.
"Because anyone who plans for the future must develop buildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically appealing, where people feel well."
"In 2021 UBM applied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-mitted to compliance with the UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals, and became an ofcial supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
We develop properties for Europes major cities.
"In line with our core strategy, the focus is on green building and smart ofce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and Prague."
"With over 150 years of experience, UBM provides a full range of development services from planning to marketing from a single source."
Ecological and social aspects play an important role in every decision because our actions today design the working and living space of tomorrow.
"Gold from EcoVadis, Prime Status from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-tications in recent years underscore UBMs commitment to sustainability."
The COVID-19 pandemic signicantly increased the pace of change in this area.
"Ecological and social sustainability are UBM Development AG is listed in the prime market seg-ment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets the highest transparency standards."
That not only means nancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all other aspects of the business model.
"UBMs corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but its activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-tan regions in ve countries Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands."
"In many of these markets, UBM has been active as a real estate developer for many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-ties and nancing banks."
U B M A T A G L A N C E Properties for Europes metropolises.
"Sustainable, technologically and emotionally intelligent and with added value."
Every decision we make in connection with the development of a property has an impact on the global climate for the coming decades.
It is a conviction that is also reflected in our green.
Our activities UBM develops and sells real estate at top locations with added value potential.
That is our DNA.
"With forward sales, we increase the momentum in our business."
Selling a property before completion means minimising the risk and setting a value for the sale which can be included in our accounting on a proportional basis during the con-struction period.
Real estate development is our core expertise.
This strategy guarantees a balance between protability and risk.
"UBMs investments are concentrated in markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, generate optimal added value for our investors over the medium to long term."
UBM acts as a one-stop shop.
"We offer all necessary ser-vices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-ment, planning and project management, nancing, rental and sale."
We can rely on a team of specialists with many years of professional experience who can accompany pro-cesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant or nal investor.
This know-how makes it possible to cover all stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.
UBMs core business is real estate development with a focus on the residential and ofce asset classes.
Over 450 apartments were sold in 2021.
"Based on the Total Output recorded in the individual countries during the past year, Germany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland for 17% and the other markets for 7%."
Our development projects are clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%.
The ofce segment covers 45%.
"The German-speaking coun-tries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of our projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed by the Czech Republic (7%) and other countries (2%)."
"The focal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in top cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna."
"For historical reasons, UBM holds properties with a total value of roughly 300m in its standing investment portfo-lio."
"These properties represent investments where the com-pany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, or properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other reasons."
"UBMs basic strategic focus, however, is that of a Pure Play Developer."
Nearly 75% of the companys book value is attributable to development.
"Competence and consequence along the value chain Competence along the entire value chain is also part of UBMs DNA, whereby sustainability is a central aspect."
Because every decision we make in connection with the development of a property has an impact on the global climate for the coming decades.
A conviction that is also reected in our green.
"The rst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for and evaluation of a location, followed by building permit and zoning issues."
The next step is the development and planning stage.
"After the necessary approvals are received and the nancing is secured, construction begins."
"General contractors, individual companies or a combination of both serve as UBMs partners."
UBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales as early as the implementation phase.
"Due to UBMs strate-gic transformation into a Pure Play Developer, the proper-ties are generally sold."
"The company also holds individual standing assets in its portfolio (31% of the total property carrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-ble for asset management."
"In line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-cycle of a property is evaluated for example: possibilities for the later use of a building through refurbishment or the recyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be actively included in the planning phase."
"Quality and experience along the value chain As a Pure Play Developer, UBM works with a wide variety of service providers and suppliers."
U B M A T A G L A N C E planning.
"The transfer of a project to realisation involves new partners: either a general contractor, individual com-panies or a combination of both."
Contractors and suppliers are organised for various management duties after comple-tion.
"The overriding principle: In the selection of its business partners, UBM places the highest priority on experience from earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-ate qualications."
There were no signicant changes in the supply chain during 2021.
International presence and stable shareholder structure UBM Development and its subsidiaries have an efcient local network which guarantees competitive positioning in the individual markets.
There were no signicant changes in the organisation dur-ing 2021.
"The share capital of UBM Development AG totalled 22,416,540 as of 31 December 2021 and is divided into 7,472,180 shares."
Most of the other free oat was held by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%).
"Teamwork, also at the top Cooperation is not only a guiding principle for UBM, but also a quality valued by top management."
"The Executive Committee includes the four Management Board members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-try and specialist managers."
The committee meets six to eight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure continuous calibration.
"The members of the Executive Com-mittee, in total, have invested approximately 5m in UBM shares and participate at 5% in an increase in the companys value through stock options."
Sustainability is an issue for management.
But not only.
The assignment of responsibilities proves that sustain- ability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter for management.
The Management Board is responsible for the organisation of and compliance with sustainability issues.
"Green build-ing and timber construction report to Martin Lcker, while Patric Thate makes sure the nancing turns green and oversees the implementation of ESG data management."
Employees & work safety as well as hotel operations are the responsibility of Martina Maly-Grtner.
"The Executive Committee regularly deals with sustainability issues, espe-cially in view of the new strategic focus on green."
UBM became one of the rst listed companies in Austria to establish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board in February 2021.
"As the senior controlling body, the Super-visory Board is now able to meet its responsibilities for the environment, society and governance through a separate committee."
The ESG Committee monitors and sup-ports activities in line with the ESG cat-alogue of measures based on the clear assignment of responsibilities at Man-agement Board and Supervisory Board levels.
"It also supervises and evaluates the implemented ESG measures above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, the use of resources, the direct and indi-rect neighbourhood, and good corpo-rate management."
Additional informa-tion on the ESG Committee can be found in the Annual Report for 2021 under the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88.
The inclusion of ESG factors in the remu-neration model will be analysed in detail in the future: Plans call for the integration of key ESG performance indicators in managements variable remuneration over the medium term.
Further information on the Supervisory Board and Manage-ment Board is provided in the Annual Report for 2021 under the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88.
Shared values as the basis Many projects in many different countries that demands a common basis to make sure everyone pulls together.
"At UBM, this means a clear strategic focus and shared values."
The foundation is created by a system of values that is based on three pillars: competent.
"Speci-cally, that means: UBM stands for high technical competence, consequent actions and full transparency."
"Based on these dened values, we have formulated the following binding goals: one goal stands for an increase in the value of the company."
"Financial performance indicators Business development and earnings With after-tax prot of 44m, UBM closed the 2021 nan-cial year with results that exceeded expectations at the start of the second pandemic year."
"This performance was supported by the selected sale of projects, without being involved in their realisation."
The consequent focus on green.
"However, successful strategic change not only requires a solid nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever before with an equity ratio of 37%."
This improvement was based primarily on property sales in Germany and Austria as well as the progress of con-struction on previously sold real estate projects which are recognised over time in accordance with the progress of completion and sale.
"The largest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-many and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the pre-development phase were successfully sold."
"Total Output for the reporting year was also inuenced, above all, by the progress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-jects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-centage of completion and realisation."
"In this category, the largest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-tial construction projects like the Gmunder Hfe in Munich and the Siebenbrunnengasse in Vienna, a project with 178 apartments designated for individual sale."
There were no material deviations in nancial costs during 2021 or 2020.
The lower tax rate in the reporting year resulted from the tax effects of equity-accounted results and a special effect from the sale of a project in Austria.
"Beginning with the 2020 nancial year, the calculation of net prot attribut-able to the shareholders of the parent company includes a deduction for the share attributable to the hybrid capi-tal holders; the comparative prior year data were adjusted accordingly."
"This increase was supported, above all, by the issue of two sustainability-linked corporate bonds which will provide added nancial exibility for business activities."
The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-ability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was nalised during the second quarter of the reporting year.
"Nearly 50% of the 2018 hybrid bond was redeemed prematurely, and this nancing was extended to 2026."
"In the second quarter of 2021, UBM issued a sustain- ability-linked bond (term: )."
A promissory note loan and bearer bond (term: ) were repaid in December 2021.
"This indicator represents current and non-cur-rent bonds and nancial liabilities, excluding lease liabil-ities, less cash and cash equivalents."
"The decline in net debt resulted, above all, from distributions from equity- accounted companies, property sales and an increase in nancial liabilities as support for investments."
"UBM IN DETAILESG which stands for Environment, Social, Governance is an integral part of our strategy."
"Our projects must meet ecological, social and legal standards to qualify as green in the sense of our an integral part of our strategyESG2."
"All our projects and transactions are green from top to bottom to meet the highest ESG standards: with green building, green nancing and green thinking."
"In that way, we anchor green, as the core idea, at all levels of our company."
D E T A I L green building.
The reduction of CO2 emissions and the careful use of resources are essen-tial requirements for every UBM pro-ject.
"In this way, we remain true to sustainability throughout the entire lifecycle of our properties from the selection of a site and preparation of the draft, through construction and operation, and up to demolition or revitalisation."
Timber construction pays off both locally and globally The selection of the materials used in building construction is clearly the most effective leverage for reducing the CO2 footprint.
The production of the concrete and steel frequently used in the construction of a building are responsible for six per cent of all CO2 emissions worldwide.
"That may sound manageable but, in fact, equals the total of all global ight, ship and rail trafc combined."
"Timber Pioneer, Frankfurt."
The production of the concrete and steel frequently used in the construction of a building is responsible for six per cent of all CO2 emissions worldwide.
"That equals the total of all global ight, ship and rail trafc combined."
"Here we are creat-ing substantially more than 100,000 m of ofce and residential space."
"In the booming Europaviertel, the rst tim-ber-hybrid ofce building in this bank-ing metropolis is currently under con-struction."
"Our Timber Pioneer, with its roughly 15,000 m of rentable space, can really show off with convincing gures."
"The 1,500 cubic metres of FSC-certied spruce will bind roughly 1,500 tonnes of CO2 in the building the same volume of cement alone would release 900 tonnes of CO2."
This state-of-the-art structure also produces enormous savings com-pared with conventional construction methods.
"Specically: a reduction of almost one third in transport costs due to materials that are up to 70 per cent lighter, 40 per cent in the weight of the entire construction, nearly 50 per cent in construction time with pre-fabricated modules and up to 80 per cent in the CO2 footprint of the shell construction."
"For instance, the wood used in construction and the aluminium in the curtain wall can be reused or recycled in many different TO CRADLE22UBM IN DETAILter in timber construction."
UBM is also setting standards in terms of energy.
The total energy requirements for heating and cooling will be generated directly at the building site.
"A well-planned network of roughly 250 geo-thermal ground probes will deliver around 4,800 MWh of heating and cooling energy."
And operations will be nearly CO2-free.
"The reversal of ground sealing and enlarged green areas as well as semi-intensive, biodiverse planting on the rooftops support the green build-ing approach."
They provide protec-tion against heat build-up and help to improve the microclimate.
"Follow-ing the development of the Quartier Belvedere Central, another large-scale UBM project in Vienna, the Leo-poldQuartier also underscores our future-oriented approach to climate protection."
Materials with more use UBM generally uses detailed lifecycle assessments to select the materials with the best durability and recycling capability.
"For every new construction project, we look far ahead and make sure roughly 95 per cent of all materi-als resulting from the demolition of our properties can be recycled into new building entire quarter in Vienna and completely energy self-sufcientOur action plan for green building includes environmental and climate aspects starting with the very rst draft."
"Pres-ervation of the landscape and city image, short transport routes and the careful use of valuable resources like the ground, water and energy are our most important guiding principles."
"For building operations, primary energy is the decisive factor and here we use geothermal power in com-bination with solar energy wherever consequent approach to timber construction, com-bined with the integration of renewable energy sources, is visibly demonstrated by the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna."
"Ofces, city apartments and ats in green surroundings and on the to the City."
Only 5 minutes away from the heart of around the corner.
The historic Augarten Park.
"As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market."
"UBM shares are listed in Viennas Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards."
We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations.
"This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies."
We also received a gold award from EcoVadis.
"In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany."
And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status.
"The costs of our bond nancing are now linked directly to our ESG successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange."
"The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating."
"Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange."
Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond.
"Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBMs commitment to reach a specic ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green nancing in a very short time."
"Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation."
Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate nancing.
"Over the longer term, we also see green bonds as attrac-tive tools for green nancing."
"However, these bonds are ear-marked for a specic use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green smart."

Sustainability not only demands an ecological approach but also socially farsighted thinking.
"We are working, step by step, to build a UBM that also leads the way with high social competence."
"As an employer, we support cooperation and fairness."
"As a developer, we create innovative building concepts for generations to come."
"As UBM, we also want to offer a real community."
"That begins in our ofces and ends with our social thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain-able, corporate-wide learning process."
"It covers UBMs training and educational programmes as well as our UBM Day, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions."
"Thats more than all trafc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector."
"As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain-ability."
The production of concrete and steel for building materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total.
"The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible."
"In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy."
"Efcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy."
"The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received."
"By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community live."
"In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening."
We organised the UBM Day for the rst time as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria.
That meant compliance with a long list of requirements from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year.
Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the Caritas am Himmel during the summer.
"In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape."
"And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area."
"A trip to the Lichtblickhof brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness."
This facility at Vien-nas Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years.
"In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre."
"They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome."
"Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time."
We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBMs underground car park.
"In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021."
"Instead, 50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland)."
"This facility houses Austrias only stationary childrens hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children."
"A number of colleagues involved with UBMs green strategy took a trip to the Austrian province of Vorarl-berg at the same time, where they reviewed model pro-jects and workshops for timber construction."
The participants in both trips gained new impressions and valuable impulses for their future work and for cooperation throughout the UBM Group.
Keeping t at the Business RunA team of 21 UBM employees also took part in the annual Busi-ness Run in Viennas Prater in 2021.
"In addition to the environment and social issues, good governance has come to play a greater role in the perception and valuation of companies."
D E T A I L Good ratings.
Great opportunities.
A number of inuential players have established a position as intermediaries between ESG requirements and the cap-ital market.
"In addition to shareholders and banks, rating agencies, analysts and international institutional investors are becoming more and more important."
"One key example is the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which has dened binding global guidelines for the preparation of sustain-ability reports."
"UBM, as an international company, already reports in accordance with the latest GRI standards to pro-vide decision-makers with comparable information and understandable performance indicators."
The ESG Committee has wide-ranging responsibilities.
"It analyses sustainability criteria and corporate social respon-sibility concepts in corporate processes and denes the most important ESG factors based on industry afliation, business model and regional inuences."
The committee also claries responsibilities at Management Board and Supervisory Board levels.
"It monitors and evaluates the ESG measures set by UBM and, for example, regularly exam-ines and documents the effects of employment and devel-opment processes."
An ESG Committee at the highest level ESG issues deserve the greatest possible attention.
"At UBM, that means they are an issue for the boss."
For exam-ple: the ESG reporting by the UBM Management Board to the Supervisory Board goes far beyond standard informa-tion.
An ESG Committee was established especially for this purpose and is comparable to the Audit Committee that reviews UBMs nancial reporting.
The integrity of our customers is regularly reviewed with a so-called KYC (Know Your Customer) check.
Routine train-ing courses are also held on the prevention of money laun-dering.
"Compliance in other words, the observance of legally required standards, especially on the capital market is given great attention."
Its therefore no surprise that UBM repeatedly receives very high marks for governance in the ESG ratings.
"In February 2021, UBM became one of the rst listed companies in Austria to establish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board."
Living sustainability.
Our strategy Protecting the future viability of our planet is one of the most important social responsibilities of our time.
"With the announcement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-scored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in the world by 2050."
Other megatrends apart from ecology are urbanisation and the demographic and social shifts in the social order.
"Silver Society describes the age-ing of society, in which health and the quality of life will be deeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness."
Changing gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes have also led to radical changes in society and the business sector.
"These developments, together with COVID-19, are the decisive factors for the megatrend New Work meaning peoples needs as regards their working world."
We see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor for our entrepreneurial actions.
"In the sense of ecological sustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-ber construction developers in Europe."
"Our actions today are already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-ible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrows users."
"As a real estate developer, we can give the office a new standing as a communication and collaboration plat-form the physical workplace then becomes a place for community and corporate culture."
"As an employer, we also take advantage of these opportunities for example, by benefitting from the additional innovation potential created by a diverse workforce."
UBM has anchored the relevance of ESG in its corporate strategy through the focus on green.
"The efficient use of resources is an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues and adherence to compliance rules."
"UBMs flagship projects, green building certifications and the activities evolving from the green."
Our primary focus is on timber construction as well as renew-able energies and green building certification.
"With the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be adapted to meet the needs of users and, at the same time, operations can be made more efficient."
"This involves aesthetics, well-being and customer experience a more that is perceptible all over."
Our sustainability activities are based on the applicable rules and regulations in the countries where we are active.
"For example: government programmes in the countries rel-evant for UBM cover issues like the expansion of renewable energy, the efficient use of energy, subsidy programmes for environmentally friendly behaviour and the strengthening of fundamental and human rights, especially in the supply chain."
"An additional framework is provided by national and supranational norms and standards, including the UN Global Compact, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the EU Green Deal and the EU Taxonomy."
We have implemented and regularly evaluate and improve the necessary processes to realise our ESG goals and related measures.
Information on our 360 process landscape and measures is provided in the following sections of this report.
Leading worldwide ESG rating agencies have confirmed UBMs strong position on the topic of sustainability.
The implementation: organisation & governance Together with the green.
We see the transformation of our conviction into con-crete actions as the shared responsibility of all employees.
Only when everyone knows and supports our internal ESG goals can ESG become part of our everyday life and have a lasting effect.
The organisation of and compliance with sustainability issues is anchored at Management Board level.
"Green building and timber construc-tion report to Martin Lcker, while Patric Thate makes sure the financing turns green and reliable ESG data management becomes reality."
Employees and work safety are the respon-sibility of Martina Maly-Grtner.
"The Management Board and Executive Committee, together with the heads of the involved specialist departments, are responsible for the implementation of ESG activities."
The rel-evance of the sustainability strategy and goals is evaluated at regular intervals and suitable goal attainment measures are defined.
"The Executive Committee frequently deals with sustainability issues, especially in view of the new strategic focus on green."
The Management Board is included in central decisions and receives routine reports on progress.
"With the help of a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), the roles and responsibilities for ESG were transparently defined and recorded."
The investor rela-tions & ESG department coordinates sustainability issues within the framework of UBMs strategy and business model and is in charge of the operative ESG reporting together with the organisation of ESG ratings.
"Its activities include the further development of the sustainability strategy, the defi-nition and monitoring of goals, and the implementation of measures together with selected specialist departments."
This department is also responsible for monitoring changes in the legal framework and serves as an information interface for the company.
The head of investor relations & ESG and the Management Board communicate regularly on current developments and issues.
The specialist departments and countries are responsible for managing and implementing sustainability issues.
These employees become involved and implement the defined measures as part of their regular day-to-day operations and in pilot projects.
Corporate governance The UBM Supervisory Board is composed of members elected by the Annual General Meeting.
The Annual General Meeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the end of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple majority of the votes cast.
The Supervisory Board elects a chairman and one or more deputies from among its mem-bers each year at a meeting held after the Annual General Meeting.
"The Supervisory Board can form committees from among its members, which can be established as permanent bodies or for individual tasks."
"In 2021, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members designated by the Works Council as employee representa-tives."
The table on the following page shows the members elected to the Supervisory Board in 2019.
"As of 31 December 2021, the members of UBMs Supervisory Board held addi-tional positions on supervisory boards or exercised compa-rable functions in Austrian and foreign companies (which are not included in the consolidated financial statements)."
These positions are listed in the table on the following page.
The chair of the highest governance body is not a senior executive in the organization.
"In accordance with the crite-ria based on C-Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the following Supervisory Board members have declared themselves as independent: Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), Birgit Wagner, Ludwig Steinbauer, Bern-hard Vanas and Susanne Weiss."
"In accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Cor-porate Governance, the Supervisory Board also conducted a self-evaluation during 2021."
"The questionnaire used for the evaluation addressed, in particular, the efficiency of the Supervisory Board, its organisation and its working proce-dures."
The findings were evaluated and discussed by the Supervisory Board.
"To support and ensure the efficient handling of complex issues, the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee were established in 2021."
"Addi-tionally, UBM became one of the first listed companies in Austria to establish an ESG committee at Supervisory Board level."
"The Supervisory Board, as the senior controlling body, now meets its responsibilities for the environment, society and governance through a separate committee."
The members of the ESG Committee and their positions are listed in the following table.
The chairperson was elected by the committee members and reports each year to the Annual General Meeting on the major ESG factors and measures.
"Members of the ESG Committee Name Iris Ortner Susanne Weiss Birgit Wagner Anke Duchow Position Chairwoman Deputy Chairwoman Member Member environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) that are determined by the companys sector affiliation and business model and subject to regional influence."
The ESG Committee is responsible for overseeing and sup-porting actions in line with the ESG catalogue of measures based on the clear assignment of responsibilities at Manage-ment Board and Supervisory Board levels.
"It also monitors and evaluates the implemented ESG measures above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, the use of resources, the direct and indirect neighbourhood, and good corporate management."
The integration of ESG in the remuneration model will be analysed in detail: ESG key performance indicators will be integrated in managements variable remuneration over the medium term.
"The remuneration for the members of the UBM Management Board implements the remuneration policy in accordance with legal regulations and consists of non-performance-re-lated components (fixed salary, pension fund/employee welfare fund contributions), performance-related compo-nents (variable performance bonus) and one-off payments as well as severance compensation for departing members."
"The variable, performance-based remuneration components are designed to reflect shareholders interests in the positive development of the company and increase the Management Boards motivation to take actions which lead to the sustaina-ble, long-term and risk-aware optimisation of Group results."
"Annual variable remuneration is dependent on the attain-ment of parameters set by the Supervisory Board, which are based on financial or non-financial criteria or a combination of both."
The fixed salary of each Management Board member is based on the scope of duties as defined in the plan for the assignment of corporate responsibilities.
Any side-line activ-ities by Management Board members require the approval of the Supervisory Board.
"If earnings are lower than the defined target, the chairman is entitled to receive a proportional amount."
Annual payments are made to a pension fund for individual Man-agement Board members.
The amount of the contribution is based on the members age and length of service with the company.
"D&O liability insurance has been contracted to cover the members of the Management Board, whereby the costs are carried by the company."
"Furthermore, UBM intro-duced a stock option programme for key managers and the Management Board in 2017."
"The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the follow-ing duties in connection with the current remuneration policy and in accordance with applicable legal regulations: (i) mat-ters related to the remuneration of the Management Board members and the content of the employment contracts with these persons, in particular, the definition and implementa-tion of the underlying principles for the remuneration of the Management Board members and the criteria for the variable remuneration components in line with Rules 27 (above all, the preparation of a catalogue for the variable remunera-tion components), 27a and 28 of the Austrian Code of Cor-porate Governance; (ii) evaluating the remuneration policy for the Management Board members at regular intervals; (iii) approving the assumption of side-line activities by the Management Board members."
The Remuneration Committee held two meetings during the reporting year.
Consultations at the meeting on 26 March 2021 included the determination of the annual bonus for the members of the Management Board.
"At the meeting on 24 June 2021, the granting of a special bonus to Management Board members Patric Thate and Martin Lcker was discussed."
"The members of the Remu-neration Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), Iris Ortner and Susanne Weiss (remuneration expert)."
Each Supervisory Board member receives an annual pay-ment for his or her services as well as reimbursement of expenses and an attendance fee for each meeting.
The amount of the attendance fee and the annual payment are determined by the Annual General Meeting.
"This is how we include stakeholders Regular contact with our internal and external stakeholders and their active inclusion in our business activities are an essential part of what we do above all, because we have an influence on many areas of life as a project developer."
The fulfilment of our social and ecological responsibility as well as UBMs long-term economic success is based on success-ful cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholders and the respectful handling of their concerns.
"In this connection, we carried out another materiality analysis in the business year 2021."
"A structured, methodical process allowed external stakeholders to contribute their views and express their concerns."
"Based on the responses from these stakeholder groups, the major issues were identified, structured and evaluated."
"We also include significant stakeholder groups through early information, participation and co-determination in planning and development processes, which gives neighbouring resi-dents an opportunity to explain their needs and interests and influence results."
This practice has been embedded in the process landscape as UBMs standard since 2021.
Additional information can be found in section 5.
"Our stakeholder dialogue uses, among others, the instru-ments listed on the following page."
Impact of sustainability issues on UBM A worst-case scenario was developed for each sustainability issue and evaluated by the Management Board together with the investor relations & ESG department.
Gross risks were evaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-bility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.
Relevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder perspective Internal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-holder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an online survey where they were asked to rank the individual issues according to their priority and to select the five most important issues.
The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders and generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return rate of 33 %).
The three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-ment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-tance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on the environment and society.
"Materiality analysis To meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-ment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate social and ecological developments."
"This process is based on the concept of double materiality, meaning an evalua-tion from the outside-in (risks from the companys viewpoint, impact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-spective (UBMs impact on people and the environment)."
A third dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder groups.
The major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part of a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions.
"This revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-national regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft (2021) and the GRI update 2021."
The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis for this ESG report and replaces the version used last year.
"The first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material issues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on megatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions with internal experts."
"The relevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder perspective UBMs impact on people, society and the environment Based on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impact on people, society and the environment were carried out together with external experts."
The ecological assessments are based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and other indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of the ecological impact.
"The social assessments are based on an estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the impact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility of the impact."
"Water consumption and waste were combined under water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building operations."
"The new issue sustainable procurement and regional added value covers social criteria in the supply chain, ecological criteria in the supply chain and regional economy & society."
"Infrastructure and mobility, which was previously included under socio-cultural environment of projects, was recorded separately."
The former issue cooperations is still an integral part of UBMs activities but is not reported as a separate entity.
"GRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2 The results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line with the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-ment, society and governance for sustainability reporting."
"Here, employees and society are covered under the same heading."
The matrix shows all three dimensions and is ori-ented on the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft as well as the GRI standards 2021.
"The three material issues for UBM are described in detail in the following sections, and the other issues are also explained."
"There were a number of changes in comparison with the materiality analysis from 2020: Energy consumption and GHG (greenhouse gases) were combined under the material issue energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions."
Fair working conditions and employee training and education were assigned to the material issue attractive employer & training and education.
Ethics & compliance was renamed corporate governance and compliance and identified as a material issue.
Users well-being and incentives for environmentally friendly behaviour were split off into customer orientation and creating awareness and healthy building materials and quality of life.
Digitalisation and technology was expanded to include innovation (innovation and technologies).
"Adaptation to climate change and biodiversity were combined into a single issue (ground sealing, adaptation to climate change and biodiversity)."
"Urban quarter development and socio-cultural environment of projects were combined under architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity."
"Sustainable Development Goals UBM is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by all UN members in 2015 as the 2030 Agenda for Sustaina-ble Development."
Governments as well as companies are called upon to make a contribution to reaching these goals.
"The framework includes 17 goals and 169 sub-goals which are related to global economic, social and ecological chal-lenges."
Our actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.
The assignment of the applicable SDGs and their sub-goals together with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and their relation to the GRI Standard is explained in greater detail in the GRI Index (see section 7).
Climate action Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
"Goals and measures in detail The consequent implementation of our commitment is underscored by the definition of goals, measures and indicators for the environment, society and governance action areas."
"Issue Goal Measures Indicators Time horizon ENVIRONMENT PROJECT DEVELOPMENT Timber construction Over 100,000 m in timber or timber-hybrid construction Energy requirements & CO2 Evaluate timber in the selection of materials for all new project construction Reduce CO2 by at least 20% with timber-hybrid construction versus conventional construction at project level Reduce primary energy demand (PED) for new projects to national nearly zero energy building standards Reduce CO2 intensity (basis 2019) by 30% for completed projects Increase share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 50% Quality gate: Every project must be evaluated to determine wheth-er timber-(hybrid) construction is possible if it is, timber-(hybrid) construction must be the method of choice Quality gate: Every project must demonstrate savings in the ecological assessment during execution planning Planning specifications for technical building services on all new projects Green building certification Brownfield development Sustainable building materials & circular economy Obtain green building certification for 100% of new developments starting in 2022 Increase share of brownfield developments in new projects to over 66% Evaluate the use of sustainable/ recycled building materials in all new development projects Use cradle-to-cradle approach in dismantling for all new development projects Green building certification for all new projects as a mandatory element of the green."
Increase number of applicants Increase quality of applicants first calculation of interview quota in 2022 Ensure high probability of hiring Create employer branding strategy to strengthen the attractiveness of UBM for potential candidates and continuously improve the candi-date experience.
Annual ESG awareness training for all employees Promote feedback culture annual appraisals with all employees Create employer branding strategy to strengthen the attractiveness of UBM for potential candidates.
"This includes a structured onboarding process for all new employees, flexible working time models, attractive remuneration, regular information for employees via internal communication channels, internal opportunities for advance-ment, and the preparation of job and skills profiles for all job classifications."
No salary differences between women and men Increase percentage of women in management positions to over 30% Increase percentage of women in the total workforce to 50% Health and safety Protect and promote employees health Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level Goal: zero work accidents GOVERNANCE Corporate governance and compliance Safeguard entrepreneurial com-pliance and responsible actions Focus recruiting on the search for suitable candidates.
"Women will be directly addressed through appropriate wording in job advertisements, and clear guidelines give preference to women when qualifications and experience are equal."
Protect psychological and physical health of employees with the help of modern occupational work and health protection management systems based on the highest standards (ISO ).
"Support for employees health is provided by in-house fitness offerings and an occupational physician, work-places are designed to promote healthy working conditions, and there is a subsidy for membership in a fitness studio."
Conscious handling of risks and their effects The realistic assessment and management of risks repre-sent an essential factor for business success and sustainable management.
One related step was the announcement in 2021 of UBMs commitment as an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
"The TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- related risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets."
The TCFD recommendations on the reporting of climate- related risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-ually implemented.
Additional information on the risk man-agement system can be found in the annual report beginning on page 119.
Governance The overall responsibility for general risk management at UBM lies with the Management Board.
The head of risk man-agement is responsible for the operational risk management process.
"A risk catalogue with the most significant individual risks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management Board, risk manager and risk coordinators."
The full Management Board was involved in this risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG department.
"Strategy Energy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of CO2 emissions are central drivers for UBMs long-term suc-cess and, consequently, an elementary part of the green."
"Given the substantial share of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing regulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and real estate sector are to be expected."
The revised EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January 2021 and deals with the energy efficiency of buildings.
It requires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy buildings (according to the respective national definition).
Buildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk being denied a building permit in the future.
That could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-sified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy.
"Moreover, the CO2 pricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-duced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages for fossil energy carriers."
Intelligent buildings and solutions for efficient building operations are anchored in this strategy with smart.
Environmental risks Environmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-ingly important for the planning and realisation of develop-ment projects.
One of the greatest challenges for real estate developers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of their activities on the environment.
Economic success and sustainable project development represent an area of ten-sion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management is the basis for economic success and economic success is the basis for sustainable management.
"The goal is to reduce environmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise business opportunities for UBM in this field."
A scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part of the materiality analysis.
Specific measures are described in greater detail in section 4.
"In the course of general risk management, the probability of occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the above-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the Management Board."
The risk system is audited annually and adapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances.
"The risks arising from daily business operations are identified, assessed and controlled through appropriate measures by operating management."
"The com-pliance function monitors adherence to external and internal rules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-ent and objective monitoring."
The evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis in 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.
The most important risks were identified with this evaluation and subsequently flowed into UBMs materiality analysis as one of the three dimensions.
"Metrics and targets UBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment and management along the three fields of environment, soci-ety and governance."
"The main goals are described on page 39, the details on page 50."
Further information can be found in the following sections.
Sustainable management is the basis for economic success and economic success is the basis for sustainable management.
"Social risks We view our responsibility as an employer, contracting firm, business partner and integral part of our social system as a central element of our economic actions."
The realisation of our projects is dependent to a significant degree on our employees.
"For that reason, UBM places high priority on attracting motivated, committed and qualified employees, giving them opportunities for development and creating an attractive working environment."
"Our success is also based on our proven quality as a business partner and contracting firm that acts with competence, reli-ability and transparency."
A scenario was developed for each social issue related to sus-tainability as part of the materiality analysis.
"The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented meas-ures are described in greater detail in section 5."
"Challenges from COVID19 A taskforce comprising the Management Board, members of the Executive Committee and internal experts was established in March 2020 in reaction to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic."
It is responsible for defining the necessary dis-tancing and hygiene measures in the company and at con-struction sites to create the safest possible working conditions under the given situation in the countries with UBM locations and projects.
Protecting the health and safety of all employees is this teams overriding goal.
The results of this fast reaction: The active communication of measures to employees and testing offers at UBMs loca-tions and construction sites minimised the effects on UBM.
Additional information on the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in the 2021 annual report beginning on page 122.
"Governance risks Responsible, transparent and future-oriented management forms the basis for a companys economic success and this economic success is the basis for sustainable management."
"Specifically, that means: The way we address major social challenges and balanced treatment for the interests of all our stakeholders are an essential and integral part of our actions."
A scenario was developed for each governance issue related to sustainability as part of the materiality analysis.
"The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented measures are described in greater detail in section 6."
The extensive catalogue of measures to deal with compliance risks covers the entire UBM Group.
"Corruption risk is viewed as part of human resources risk (among others, internal fraud, corrupt behaviour) and flows into the risk assessment, risk map and overall aggregation."
ESG reporting UBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-trian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has voluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in line with the latest GRI standards since 2020.
"Consequently, the company is very well prepared to address the information requirements at the product and corporate levels that will result from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation."
This ESG report serves as a progress report for the UN Global Compact.
"In connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the coming years which were set in 2021, the ESG report is a valuable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-ity to society."
"The ESG report describes the management approaches, goals and measures related to the environment, society and governance, and highlights successes as well as challenges."
The subject areas are based on the materiality analysis carried out in 2021.
The ESG report is prepared by the investor relations & ESG department in coordination with the specialist departments and released by the Management Board.
"Additional information on UBM, its business devel-opment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 annual report."
"Transparency and reliability are also decisive for our ESG reporting, and we therefore arranged for an external lim-ited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is provided on page 125)."
UBM also introduced a central data management tool in 2021 which will be successively filled starting in 2022.
The goal is to create an informative basis for the definition of internal goals and external evaluations.
"Controlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while data collection takes place directly in the respective areas and departments in the individual countries."
ESG ratings Leading global ESG rating agencies have confirmed UBMs strong position on the topic of sustainability.
The rating by ISS ESG resulted in Prime Status (Level C+) for UBM Development.
That makes UBM Development one of the most sustainable companies in its sector in Germany and Austria.
"The corporate rating by ISS ESG evaluates the ecological and social performance of a company based on more than 100 selected sector-specific ecological, social and corporate gov-ernance criteria."
The company has been a member of the Institute for Corporate Governance (ICG) since 2019 and contributes to the ICGs social impact investment initia-tive.
"In addition, UBM is a member of the corporate platform respACT (Austrian Council for Sustainable Development), the Austrian Sustainable Building Council (sterreichische Gesellschaft fr Nachhaltige Immobilienwirtschaft, GNI) and Hotel Management Associates (HAMA)."
UBM expanded its active participation in the interest group IG-Lebenszyklus Bau to include membership in 2020.
"The organisations working group on the shortage of land is headed, among others, by Gerald Beck, managing director of UBM Austria."
We are committed to finding ways to stop the wasteful use of the limited resource land with existing and new framework conditions.
"We also play an active role in the Association of Austrian Project Developers (Vereinigung der sterreichischen Pro-jektentwickler, VPE)."
"Together with other VPE members, UBM shows that project developers can be strong and reli-able partners for the general public and the public sector in the creation of living environments."
The first evaluation by the internationally recognised ESG rat-ing agency EcoVadis led to Gold for UBM Development AG.
"UBM now belongs to the top two per cent of the sector (real estate and housing) and the top five per cent of the 75,000 companies graded by EcoVadis."
"This evaluation is based on 21 criteria from the four most important sustainability aspects: environment, labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable reporting."
UBMs per-formance exceeded the sector average in all four categories.
"Memberships Our actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, a network of the future which UBM joined in 2021."
"UBM has also been an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2021, where it is one of more than 2,500 organisations com-mitted to fighting climate risks and developing a more resist-ant financial system through better disclosure."
Our company.
Our environment.
"The real estate and construction sector is, from the global viewpoint, the most CO2-and energy-intensive area."
It there-fore goes without saying that ecological aspects play a key role in all our decisions.
"Our focus on green building, our commitment to wood construction, and renewable energies and energy efficiency are an expression of this conviction."
"Future-oriented real estate development As a real estate developer, we design the living space of the future and that means we also design the environment."
"Real estate development is not only our core business, it also gives us the greatest leverage to significantly reduce our carbon footprint."
"Consequently, UBM directly addresses the ecolog-ical impact of its activities in all project phases with a con-stant focus on environmental protection and the careful use of resources."
"Other and Mix [number] 711,709 133,765 129,899 382,121 65,924 54 9 8 35 2 2021 118,104 5,430 51,149 47,072 14,453 10 1 4 4 1 2020 129,269 44,407 8,046 76,816 0 10 2 1 7 0 2019 70,431 2,451 39,010 28,260 710 8 1 3 3 1 1 The data covers all projects in the pipeline, including the projects completed in 2021."
"We measure our locations based on their footprint In addition to our development projects, we want to make our own business operations more sustainable."
UBM has office space at 19 locations.
Our goal in this area is to steadily reduce our ecological footprint.
The efficient use of water and correct waste man-agement are also important issues for UBM and are internally managed and reported.
The strategic focus of UBMs business activities includes the development and sale of properties.
"Accordingly, the number of standing assets has been steadily reduced since 2015."
"UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these properties here, the key issue is whether the properties are rented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on energy consumption and emissions, for example through the use of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling solutions."
The EU Green Deal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in this context.
It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-house gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU.
This important interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on course to become the worlds first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
"Related activities include the European Commis-sions Fit for 55 package which includes draft legislation in the areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use of land and forestry operations."
"The requirements include, among others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-cate trading and CO2 taxes)."
"Other sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy currently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and establish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-mate protection measures and the related reporting."
Invest-ments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-omy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future.
"Various players including companies, investors, public institutions and con-sumers are called on to accept responsibility and support the attainment of these goals with effective measures."
These ambitious goals represent a challenge for the real estate sector because energy consumption and the related greenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their entire lifecycle have a significant influence on the climate footprint.
The construction and operation of real estate are responsible for nearly 40% of global CO2 emissions and over one third of worldwide energy consumption (UNEP 2020).
The real estate sector therefore plays an important role reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.
"Our commitment Through the development of new projects, we create urgently needed living space for society."
"We want to support the global agenda and attach great importance to environmen-tally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-struction methods."
"The carbon footprint of a property can be substantially reduced, both during construction and in later building operations."
"Our focus is on low-emission building materials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of renewable energies."
"Our commitment to and investments in timber construction are important because of their significant, inherent capability to reduce the carbon footprint."
"Every cubic metre of wood stores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-duction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results in CO2 emissions."
The production of the concrete and steel frequently used in building construction is responsible for no less than six per cent of all CO2 emissions worldwide.
"Our goal here is to create significantly more than 100,000 square metres of office and residential space in timber-hybrid construction by 2025."
"The energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM (offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment and is a material cost factor for tenants and users."
"As early as the planning phase, the energy consumption from the construction and operation of a building can be reduced."
"Efficient measures include, among others, good insulation, energy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-tation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the energy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and cooling) with modern sensors."
We are working intensively to develop smart buildings that ultimately consume less energy and resources.
This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting or options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers.
"The options for connecting to geothermal power and similar sources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location and acquiring the site."
Our green.
It is deeply anchored in processes and represents an integral part of all phases.
Processes are operationally standardised through an institutionalised 360 principle.
"More specifically: As part of the Next Level efficiency programme, all core and sup-port processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-ity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group."
These processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus on green.
"For example: Every project must include an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber as a building material, greening and the on-site generation of renewable energy through photovoltaics as only several examples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide processes."
Additional information on the 360 process land-scape can be found in section 6.
"For new projects, we build with timber and operate with renewable energy wherever possible."
Sustainability certifications are a suitable measurement instrument to make building performance on the real estate market comparable and to draw conclusions and learn from the results.
"For many years, we have actively, and based on our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our properties."
"All new construction projects are sustainably planned, built and subject to a sustainability assessment based on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems."
"UBM has set a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve certification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, but also for all new projects in the residential asset class at the latest by 2025."
"As a pure property developer, we work with a wide range of suppliers and service providers."
"Our business partners are required to meet the same high standards, for example strict environmental requirements for suppliers production processes and building material components."
Environmental protection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement (further information can be found in section 6).
The focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations is also increasing.
"The corporate units in Austria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified under the international environmental management norm ISO and quality management norm ISO 9001, and UBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022."
The project managers are responsible for the operational implementation of the green building strategy in develop-ment projects.
The implementation of the green building strategy in standing assets and at Group locations is the responsibility of UBMs asset managers.
They implement the measures defined by green building to reduce the CO2 emissions from these properties.
The timber construction department with its five experts is the competence centre for timber construction and contributes directly to UBMs strategic focus.
All projects are carefully reviewed by UBMs Management Board and must be approved.
"Goals and measures Property development Goals from our sustainability programme: Timber construction Green building certification Reduction of CO2 by 30% To reach these ambitious goals, UBM implements specifically designed measures to reduce energy consumption in its pro-jects."
Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for building shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-nical equipment.
The use of timber as a building material makes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.
An active commitment to sustainability best practices makes it possible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to opti-mise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 emissions.
"Our binding ethics code, in which the subject of environmental protection is anchored, creates the foundation for all business activities and decisions, whereby compliance is confirmed in writing by our employees (see section 6 for further information)."
"The United Nations recommends three steps to achieve cli-mate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, finally, compensate for unavoidable emissions."
We calcu-late our emissions based on the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol and monitor and report on our performance.
"In cases where there is a lack of low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates as compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising from electricity consumption in selected standing assets or Group locations."
"In order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM established the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022."
This non-profit foundation includes partners from industry and science who work together to develop tech-nical applications for smart buildings.
The foundation com-plements our green.
Its goals include the long-term reduction of emissions and resource consumption as well as the optimisation of eco-nomic feasibility for sustainable office and residential con-cepts.
The first use case deals with consumption-and capac-ity-optimised office properties.
Organisational structure The green building department supports and monitors the operational implementation of green building processes.
New requirements at national and European level are eval-uated and implemented at project level in agreement with the green.
This department also coordinates the evaluation and organisation of building cer-tification for development projects by external partners.
"In order to ensure the conscious selection of materials for the construction of buildings, every development project begins with the question: Can it be realised with timber construction?"
The lifecycle assessment for every timber construction pro-ject must demonstrate savings compared with conventional construction methods when realisation is planned.
A test will compare the different construction methods under the same condi-tions.
"One of the seven identical buildings was built as a wood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid method."
"The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna is accompanying the project with a study which will document the long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, practical comparison."
"The positive experience from this Vienna project was also transferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-ing permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-ber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build in timber-hybrid construction."
"This structure (construction, maintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 reduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-struction methods."
One challenge for timber construction is the current lack of specialists in the executing companies.
"The strong dynamics on the timber market were a further source of uncertainty during the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber price stabilised at a level where this raw material is available at a reasonable price."
"Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 50% by 2030 To meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined the primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-ning of technical building equipment in all new development projects."
"The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-tems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-tion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or equipment."
"The durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-ond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: The specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life Cycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA/lifecycle evaluations)."
"These planning tools make it possible to determine and, where necessary, to optimise the energy requirements and CO2 emissions of buildings from construction to maintenance and dismantling."
The calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is based on the final energy requirements in the respective project.
"The energy intensity depends on the project specifics (asset class, countries) and is therefore subject to fluctuations."
"Energy indicators real estate development Total calculated energy consumption [kWh] GFA of development projects [m] Calculated energy intensity [kWh/m] Direct/Indirect GHG emissions [t]1 Intensity of GHG emissions [kg/m]1 Property area in total [m] 2021 11,165,679 118,104 95 3,132 27 45,678 2020 9,515,538 129,269 74 2,460 19 47,783 2019 7,243,201 70,431 103 1,920 27 25,884 1 Information on the emission factors used can be found in chapter 7."
The energy consumption in the project development is calculated as per certificates.
Green building certification Obtain green building certification for 100% of new developments starting in 2022 UBM expanded its sustainability strategy in 2021 to include internationally recognised certification for the residential con-struction projects that are designated for global sale.
Green building certification for all new projects is a mandatory element of the 360 principle.
"In addition, the profiles dis- mantling and construction site were added to the certifica-tion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project in Vienna."
"UBM has decided to extend its certifications to refurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call for the continuation of this strategy."
"Four projects in each of these two classes, with 47,072 m (residential) and 51,149 m (hotels) of GFA were completed, each represent-ing 40% of the total completions."
"Six of the ten projects completed in 2021, representing 100% of the commercial properties, successfully completed a sus-tainability assessment."
"In total, 71,032 m of the 118,104m GFA completed in that year, or 60%, were certified."
"The four uncertified projects are residential projects which were started before UBMs strategic reorientation, and certification was therefore not carried out."
UBM plans to continue building certification as confirmation of the sustainability of its property developments.
All projects in all asset classes in the pipeline will undergo a sustainabil-ity assessment in the future to support the attainment of the defined goals over the long term.
Building certification will also be used as a tool to implement the requirements of the EU Taxonomy in established systems.
Vehicles Double the number of vehicles with alternative drives by 2025 (basis 2021) Records have been kept on the petrol and diesel consump-tion of all Group motor vehicles since 2020.
These surveys provide the basis for defining concrete targets to reduce emissions.
"Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles when new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also involves the availability of suitable charging stations near the employees home."
"In 2021, UBMs motor vehicle pool had 18 vehicles with alternative drives."
The Group-wide travel guideline think before you travel makes clear that business trips should only be taken when absolutely necessary.
"Rail travel must be given preference for shorter distances, and video conference portals should be used more frequently for meetings."
The use of these digital formats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"For the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria travelled to Vienna to experience our Groups commu-nity live."
This event was certified as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria.
"That meant compliance with a long list of requirements including environmentally friendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation."
A limited number of the participants travelled via air due to the longer distances.
"To meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting its Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-ping or refitting these facilities with building management systems to support energy optimisation."
One challenge in this area is the availability of sustainable electricity.
"The share of renewable energy in UBMs total energy consumption in 2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, 15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic."
CO2 certificates were purchased for the Groups location in Warsaw due to the lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the emissions from electricity consumption.
"In accordance with the GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not have an impact on reported emissions."
"The contracts for all locations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland will be converted to green electricity, where available, at the latest in 2025."
UBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-plies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-works and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers.
Ener-gy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations are renovated.
"UBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-ciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act)."
"All invest-ments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development projects) and locations are covered by these procedures."
"An external energy audit was carried out at the German and Austrian locations in 2019, and verification audits based on ISO took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) during 2020 and 2001."
"ISO audits are scheduled for Germany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will follow."
An important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will be expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more exact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-sions.
This will support the development of further climate protection initiatives in the future.
Recyclability & durability of building materials Increase in renewable energy Goals and measures in detail: Renewable energy Increase the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 30% by 2025 UBM is converting not only its Group locations but also its standing assets to green electricity suppliers.
"The W3, a stand-ing asset in Vienna, already purchases green electricity and, in addition to district heating, is also changing over to district cooling."
A manage to green project is currently in progress at the Poleczki Business Park in Poland.
It involves the neutral-isation of CO2 emissions from the total electricity consump-tion in 2021 and 2022 through certificates because green electricity is not available at that location.
"In order to ensure the long-term availability of renewable energy, photovoltaic equipment is currently being installed on the rooftop of one of the office buildings in the commercial park."
Energy management & CO2 intensity Reduce CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2020) by 2030 Establish/Optimise building management systems at all standing assets by 2022 Anchor guideline for sustainable building operations in all standing assets by 2022 UBM is equipping or refitting all standing assets with build-ing management systems to support energy optimisation.
CO2 intensity will be reduced by refitting with highly efficient energy systems and building automation.
"In addition, a guide-line for sustainable building operations will be prepared for all tenants."
"GRI 3-3 In property development, the early planning phase defines the scope of the ecological footprint and can be seen as the key to an efficient circular economy."
"Our focus on struc-tural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their durability and their recycling capability."
Investments that fail to meet these requirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future.
"They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the lower consumption of resources."
"Timber, as a renewable raw material, stores carbon over the long term and is character-ised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity combined with flexibility."
"Timber also creates time and cost benefits through prefabrication and modular construction, lower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased space through narrower wall construction."
"And last but not least, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-faces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on the indoor climate."
"With timber construction, we have the largest lever in our hands as a real estate developer."
"The production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 intensive, and these materials should be recycled when a building is demolished."
Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions over the entire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping with the focus on sustainability.
"Ground sealing, climate change adjustments and biodiversity Urban development inevitably leads to interference with the local fauna and flora."
"The direct consequences of construction activity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats and an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated areas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater due to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk of highwater and flooding."
Increased ground sealing changes the microclimate local temperatures increase and new heat records are set (heat islands) and can cause serious health problems for the people involved.
Investments that lead to negative effects for the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-tage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future.
Building permits in Austria are granted under sustainability aspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and biodiversity.
"UBMs goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-oped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground sealing."
"Preference is given to development projects located in urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are embedded in an existing infrastructure."
"Timber can be easily recycled untreated wood can be reused or recycled, while dirtied or treated wood can be used as a renewable energy carrier."
"In this way, UBM supports recycling in the sense of the circular economy."
Goals and measures in detail: Sustainable building materials & circular economy Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building materials in all new development projects Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling for all new development projects The planning stage for all UBM projects must include and evaluate the use of sustainable and/or recycled building materials.
Circular economy requirements are passed on to the planners.
"The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to optimise the selection of materials and component assembly and make an important contribution to resource conservation, the reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return to the materials cycle."
"In the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-ing is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with our green."
"Special attention is given to recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-ally no landfill deposits are required."
"Most of the materials are separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is placed on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-cling location."
And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of all materials resulting from demolition can be reused.
The LeopoldQuartier was awarded Gold certification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.
"UBMs value chain for real estate development begins with an acquisition, or the purchase of a site."
We never use land in protected or sensitive areas for our projects.
"However, the realisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with intervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the destruction of free space, for example."
UBM therefore focuses on so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-sion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and limit ground sealing.
"In addition to conscious interaction with the resource land, the preservation of biological diversity is another important concern."
It will be reflected in future projects through roof-tops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and facade greening which will help to reduce the heat island effect in our urban areas as well as the heating and cooling load.
"UBMs focal points for biodiversity are as follows: Brownfield developments Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities Increase in biological diversity through roof and facade greening Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening Goal from our sustainability programme: Brownfield development Goals and measures in detail: Brownfield development Increase share of brownfield developments in new projects to over 66% by 2025 As mentioned above, UBMs acquisition process is focused on brownfield developments (land with existing buildings)."
Biodiversity has been integrated in UBMs 360 process land-scape.
"Our reporting on development projects is based solely on the sealed areas, with a differentiation between greenfield and brownfield."
"Greenfield developments represent roughly 24% of the 45,678 m in the ten projects completed during 2021."
"We also exchanged an area of 24,290 m on four brownfield projects."
Refurbishment and revitalisation Total pipeline incl.
"The acquisition of developed land, in part with existing buildings, leads to increased requirements for demolition, refurbishment or revitalisation."
"Stricter legal requirements for building demolition can be expected in the future, for example through the consequent separation of construction and demolition waste or the production of quality-assured secondary building materials."
Refurbishment projects are a fixed and steadily increasing component of UBMs real estate development portfolio.
"In comparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-tion, the conversion and vitalisation of existing buildings results in lower energy consumption and lower CO2 emis-sions an important ecological aspect that will also be taken into account in the future."
"Other resource-conserving benefits include the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new soil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and the preservation of existing building substance."
"The lifecycle of a building is extended as a result, and that reduces CO2 emissions."
UBM has increased its focus on projects involving revitalisa-tion and has also set a goal to evaluate all refurbishment pro-jects based on sustainability criteria.
"Two projects underwent building certification in 2021, namely the Andaz Sugar Pal-ace in Prague (LEED) and the voco in The Hague (BREEAM)."
"Of the 54 development projects in UBMs pipeline at the end 2021, six involved refurbishment and revitalisation during the construction and development phase."
"Thus, the projects on the following page are responsible for 75,769 m of the total pipeline (711,709 m GFA)."
Renovation and revitalisation projects real estate development Projects total pipeline incl.
"New construction projects [number] GRI 2-23, 2-25 Hotel Residential Commercial Hotel Residential Commercial Residential completed under constr."
"Healthy building materials & the quality of life The use of healthy building materials has a positive influence on the indoor climate in UBMs buildings and the comfort for residents, office tenants and hotel guests."
UBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building certification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-ing materials.
Timber surfaces equal-ise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the indoor climate.
"In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to its pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere."
"This is due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal insulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived as comfortable."
"Water and wastewater utilisation and waste in building operations Examples of the measures taken in the standing assets and Group locations are provided below: At the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and facility management have developed a waste concept."
We also ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna based on an established concept.
A digital solution for waste management similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-ration.
Paperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in 2020.
That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption and also complements the previously established controlling systems.
"On UBM Day, which was certified as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were also implemented to minimise waste."
"Disposable tableware was not used, the decorations were rented or designed for multiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all waste was correctly separated."
"GRI 2-23, 2-25 In the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-tion play an important role."
The recycling of rainwater and grey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings in kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of fresh water.
Water stress areas are areas in which the demand for water exceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where the usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-ity.
"Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively unaffected by water stress at the present time."
"Although consumption is primarily influenced by end users, we still implement effective measures."
One example is the Mercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 green facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol of the green and clean motto.
"Nearly 7,000 plants root in pockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on textile panels."
This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater collected in the basement.
Waste management is also important in building operations.
"The avoidance of waste saves energy and resources, and the organised collection of waste allows for correct material recycling."
"End users, in particular, can also influence waste generation and separation."
Social responsibility.
For employees and society.
Sustainable management is in no way limited to environ- mental aspects.
"It also covers a companys social responsibil-ity, in other words the impact of its actions on society."
Attractive employer & training and education This also includes fair and responsible interaction with our employees in our direct sphere of influence.
The women and men who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-term success and essential for the positive development of our company.
"Attractive employer and training & education Diversity and equal opportunities Health and occupational safety As a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local communities and neighbouring residents."
Our projects contribute to the quality of life for society.
"This applies, in particular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true for residential construction and office buildings."
We are well aware that we change and influence the living environment of people with every real estate development project.
That creates a responsibility which we actively accept.
"Our goal is, wherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with neighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the areas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement through our activities."
This added value and neighbourhood vitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.
"Architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity Infrastructure & mobility Customer orientation and awareness creation We are well aware that we change and influence the living environment of people with every real estate development project."
Importance of the issue Qualified and motivated employees are an important factor for our companys long-term success.
Attracting and retaining these women and men calls for an environment in which per-sonal development is possible and community is supported.
"The understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is undergoing a paradigm shift which has been accelerated by the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid increase in digitalisation."
"Values like purpose, the work-life balance and creative opportunities are becoming more and more important."
"New work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for working hours and locations."
"However, a functioning remote work culture can never completely replace the office with its spontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, and sharing and shaping."
"Offices will, consequently, not become irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is where a company becomes visible, that is where community becomes real."
The office will become a place where coexist-ence is lived and new ideas are born.
The study The State of Skills 2021 shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but also reduced development opportunities.
"Limited possibil-ities to invest in learning and development, combined with rising demands on new skills and competences can cause problems at several levels over the long term."
"Employees with insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their activities at a higher quality level and when confidence in their own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, assignments take longer, and both quality and motivation decline."
"Expanding know-how and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and supporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and satisfaction for everyone involved."
"A greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop and retain sufficient specialists and managers."
A lack of opportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and productivity.
"That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, recruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company."
"In the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an attractive employer is decisive."
The basis is formed by com-pliance with the respective national laws governing employ-ment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well as consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-dations of the International Labour Organisation.
"Employers must respect human rights, reject child labour and forced labour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-ers, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair compensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the rejection of any form of discrimination."
"Unattractive working conditions can damage a companys reputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-rienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour market."
News of bad experience with employers in online application platforms or social media can also be expected to spread rapidly.
"In the end, the companys positioning on the market will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential employees may wander to the competition."
"Our commitment We owe our success to our talented, committed employ-ees who take on individual responsibility and want to play an active role in designing UBMs success."
"UBM supports its employees in reaching their personal career goals and offers them opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and development possibilities and numerous benefits."
With our values competent.
We encourage our employees to be proactive through short decision paths and flat hierarchies.
The design of our working environment reflects our strict com-pliance with the national and international rules and require-ments in the markets where we are active.
"We also base our actions on agreements that include the Universal Declara-tion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation."
Our activities exceed minimum standards.
Modern workplace & community Open communications are a central element of our corpo-rate values and an important building block for our attractive-ness as an employer.
"At all our locations, we create working spaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and performance of our employees."
"The headquarters in Vienna, for example, include a lounge with table football and darts as well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a barbecue area."
Specially created new work zones serve as multifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing as a communication and collaboration platform.
"Our Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, supports the exchange of information and an open corporate culture across business areas and national borders."
"In addi-tion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise events like barista workshops and joint participation in sport events to promote teambuilding."
Work-life balance We believe it is important to help our employees establish a healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and family life.
Individual working time models are part of our efforts in this area.
"Rules are in place, and formalised in the company agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family members."
"Employees have access to special time off under certain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-tled to parental leave."
Open communications are a central element of our corporate values and an important building block for our attractiveness as an employer.
"Performance-based remuneration With very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that are tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM employees participate in the companys success."
"Benefits Additional benefits include, among others, the reimburse-ment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-sidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-ance."
Special projects to help employees remain healthy include in-house fitness programmes and a subsidy for annual membership in a fitness studio.
An important part of this policy specifies that these benefits are also available to part-time employees.
"In this respect, UBM does not differen-tiate between full-time and part-time employees."
"Career, training and continuing education Specially planned training and continuing education pro-grammes are a fixed part of human resources development at UBM."
"The basis is formed by the annual appraisal meet-ing, which includes an agreement on goals and specific training measures together with the responsible supervisor."
"UBM actively offers numerous educational opportunities ranging from internal workshops and idea competitions to external training programmes, but also encourages and supports the independent development of its employees."
"GRI 2-23, 2-25, 3-3, 401-2, 404-2 We actively offer numerous devel-opment opportunities as part of our human resources strategy, but also encourage employees independent development."
"Organisational structure At the Management Board level, the COO is responsible for personnel-related issues which are centrally combined under human resources."
The head of human resources meets regularly with the COO to discuss developments in this area.
"Targets, measures and the strategic focus are defined together with the Management Board and communicated to the organisation."
The human resources team also includes an HR business partner who implements human resources measures together with local management in agreement with the HR strategy.
"Goals and measures Goals from our sustainability programme: Minimise employee turnover Yearly ESG training Goals and measures in detail: Recruit the best employees for UBM Increase number of applicants Increase quality of applicants and continuous increase starting in 2022 Ensure high probability of hiring To reach these goals, UBM has implemented targeted meas-ures to establish an employer branding strategy."
Its goal is to increase the attractiveness of UBM as an employer for potential applicants and to continuously improve the candi-date experience.
"The indicators used to monitor target attainment include the number of applications per advertised position, interview quota (first survey scheduled for 2022), the offer-acceptance rate or time-to-hire after the job advertisement."
The creation of an employer branding strategy will also increase the attractiveness of UBM for existing employees.
"The related measures include a structured onboarding pro-cess for all new employees, flexible working time models, attractive remuneration, regular information for employees via internal communication channels, internal opportunities for advancement, and the preparation of job and skills pro-files for all job classifications."
"Other indicators for internal monitoring include aver-age length of service with the company, the share of man-agement positions filled internally and the recommendation quota."
"Annual ESG awareness training for all employees starting in 2022 Individual, requirements-oriented training measures are defined in regular personnel development and feedback discussions with employees based on an internal guideline."
"These discussions are held with all employees, regardless of the hierarchy level."
A project is currently in progress to sup-port the organised recording of employee appraisals.
The COVID-19 pandemic created an additional challenge by limiting the offering and resulting in the cancellation of training courses and seminars.
The percentage of employees who participated in training fell from 65% in 2020 to 35% in 2021.
"However, the average hours of training per employee remained constant at around 17 hours."
"In 2021, a special training initiative was launched in support of ESG issues: Numerous employees voluntarily took part in the Climate Impact Day to improve their understanding of ESG."
The active participation of all employees in this event is planned to begin in 2022.
Diversity and equal opportunities A working environment free of discrimination and a culture of mutual respect and appreciation throughout the entire workforce these are the requirements for equal opportu-nities and diversity in a company.
"A company that does not promote diversity and equal opportunities risks damage to its reputation and, in the worst case, could be faced with legal consequences."
Poor performance in this area can undermine a companys position on the market and result in the loss of business part-ners and customers.
"Moreover, there are signs that the legal requirements governing equal opportunities will be strengthened in the future."
Fair treatment of our employees and a culture of mutual respect and appreciation are obvious at UBM.
"We treat all employees equally regardless of their ethnic, national or social background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or religious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic or other standing."
Decisive action is taken against any form of discrimination.
Goal from our sustainability programme: Over 30% women in management positions Goals and measures in detail: No salary differences between women and men by 2025 (adjusted gender pay gap) Increase percentage of women in management positions to over 30% by 2025 Increase percentage of women in the total workforce to ca.
It allows us to utilise the full potential of the labour market and innovation by includ-ing people with different backgrounds and viewpoints.
"The employment of staff with different ages and experience is encouraged (buddy principle), and the company is increasing its efforts to raise the percentage of female employees in the organisation."
Activities to sustainably improve equal opportunities include recruiting that is focused on the search for suitable female candidates.
"Women are directly addressed through appro-priate wording in job advertisements, and clear guidelines give preference to women when qualifications and experi-ence are equal."
"In new hiring, there are no salary differences between the genders when the function, qualifications and seniority are equal."
"Starting in 2022, we plan to calculate the adjusted gender pay gap for the entire company as the basis for implementing specific measures."
"In comparison with other companies in the real estate sector, the UBM Group had a positive standing with 25 women in key positions as of 31 December 2021 (Supervisory Board, managing directors, authorised signatories and key staff at UBM Development AG and its subsidiaries)."
A comparison with the 24 female managers in 2020 shows an improvement in the share of women in leading positions.
Specific instructions give women preference when qualifications and experience are equal.
The Supervisory Board does not follow a specific diversity concept with regard to the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards because the establishment of diver-sity targets for control bodies is not seen as expedient or use-ful.
Education and professional experience play a significant role because a person under consideration for a Supervisory Board position must be capable of optimally performing his or her duties.
These preconditions are not defined abstractly in advance but evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
"Accord-ingly, the expertise and specific requirements for the respec-tive appointment are the only decisive factors in preparing proposals for the Annual General Meeting."
Women represent 25% of the positions on the Management Board and 33% on the Supervisory Board.
"Health and safety Work absences can result in financial damages, the loss of know-how and productivity declines."
"In office settings, health and injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-ical aspects."
"Construction sites are associated with health and injury risks, among others through severe or fatal accidents."
"These accidents have a direct neg-ative effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-istrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal consequences for the employer."
Our business success is based to a significant degree on the commitment and motivation of our employees.
"As an employer, we also feel responsible for their physical and psychological health."
UBM has implemented an integrated management system to support occupational health and safety.
It covers all employ-ees and meets the highest standards.
"The Group units in Aus-tria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified under the internationally recognised occupational health and safety management norm ISO , and certifi-cation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022."
"Occupational safety management includes experts like occu-pational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and employee representatives in line with national requirements."
"Safety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-uates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety inspections."
Written instructions anchor occupational safety throughout the company and ensure compliance with high safety standards.
"The success of these measures is reflected in the number of work accidents, which has been extremely low for many years."
There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-dents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021.
"Moreover, no work- related illnesses were recorded."
"In addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-ority on employees health."
"The related measures include, among others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and the opportunity to individually use the in-house fitness rooms."
Outdoor athletes can join the UBM-Express and take part in various running events.
An occupational physi-cian is also available to assist employees at UBMs Vienna location.
"Architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity The coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards an ageing and more multinational society."
"The growing eco-logical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased to also include social aspects."
"Todays development projects should reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-ing and working to also meet the needs of tomorrows users."
The failure to include carefully thought-out architectural concepts for buildings and urban development projects can result in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs of the future.
A balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the basis for the sustainable development of residential areas.
Smart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-efits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings for users and neighbouring residents.
The creation of recrea-tional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases the quality of life in the surrounding area.
Our many years of experience as a real estate developer have taught us that development means change and inter-action.
One of our key principles is to always consider and integrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects.
"For us, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-tial negative effects on the local area, for example caused by shading, artificial light, noise, emission and increased traffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive changes and improvements."
The health and well-being of later users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in project development.
"Included here, for example, are room temperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the optical design."
"To make these phrases come alive, our approach includes sustainability certificates like DGNB and GNI as key meas-urement and control instruments."
"Evaluation is based on the three-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and society."
Our projects create living and working space that influences the health and well-being of future residents and users.
UBM therefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of the building materials used and the integration of the demo-graphic shift in its construction projects.
UBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-mative requirements on its buildings.
But our claim goes far beyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements whenever this is important to future users.
The following key aspects for the functionality of buildings represent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its real estate projects: Accessibility Absence of pollutants and construction ecology Indoor climate and acoustics Security Visual comfort (look & feel) UBM sees building certification through its continuous development and adaptation to meet new market demands and trends as an important tool to make sure its projects are fit for the future.
Every project is designed to meet the green.
Infrastructure and mobility The steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges for municipal planning and development.
"Modern mobility concepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real estate planning and the design of urban quarters."
Sustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage concept for the specific building and for its urban quarter.
"Connections to public transportation, in particu-lar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of living, working and hotel stays."
"UBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-oped a future-oriented mobility concept for the Timber Pioneer project in Frankfurt am Main."
The goal is to reduce the use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-tination and origin transportation.
"At the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be able to use e-charging stations in the office and residential areas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing products."
"The Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, is currently carrying out a manage to green project that involves the refitting of two buildings to include parking spaces with e-charging stations."
"If the test phase is successful, e-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking spaces in the business park."
Customer orientation and awareness raising A focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads to longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and complaints.
"Customer orientation measures can include the early involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for important issues raised by different social groups, or conflict management processes."
The creation of a greater aware-ness of sustainability issues can also improve users sense of well-being.
"Insufficient or a complete lack of customer orientation can lead to declining revenues, market access problems and lower corporate profitability."
UBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to sustainable urban development and create benefits for the general public.
These quarters must be resistant against com-ing climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in the future.
The development of an urban quarter means much more than just planning and constructing a building.
"Many dif-ferent stakeholder groups are involved in these activities, including project developers, planners, public authorities and district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, and the complexity is accordingly high."
"We involve rele-vant stakeholder groups in our planning and development processes through early information, participation and co- determination rights."
That allows neighbouring residents to express their needs and interests and influence results.
This approach has been embedded in UBMs process landscape as the standard since 2021.
"We involve relevant stakeholder groups in our planning and development processes at an early stage through information, participa-tion and co-determination rights."
"In this way, initial reservations by a citizens initiative concern-ing a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder Hfe in Munich were successfully dispelled."
The goal for this project and for all other UBM developments is to also create an optimal usage mix for the city.
"In addition to attrac-tive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, green and open areas available for public use, other benefits include the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and good public transportation connections via underground and rapid transit railway."
The LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-cessful participative urban development.
This area is under development based on specifications set by the citys devel-opment commission and the integration of citizens concerns.
"Up-to-date information on the progress of construction is published on a project website, and an ombudsman service is available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints."
"In close cooperation with the representatives of public authorities, decisions are coordinated on relevant issues involving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects like working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible reduction of emissions and immissions."
The instruments to reach these goals are diverse.
"Green areas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground storage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time data on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-tion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-tier and will create exemplary added value."
"In particular, the green zone an expanded green area in the inner courtyard is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the quality of life for all users and neighbouring residents."
"Special attention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-tion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-ditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-sive biodiverse planting."
Photovoltaic elements will also be installed on these roofs to create a balance between energy production and climate improvement.
The LeopoldQuartier will generate energy on site with wells and depth probes.
Heating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter will be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.
"Local supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are the basic components of this urban quarter development project."
"In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and shared activities, the use of a quarter management app is also under evaluation to make the offerings and services available to users and neighbours."
All these measures will help to create smart and green living space that sustainably increases and improves the value of the area surrounding the LeopoldQuartier.
The LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the implementation of its green.
Construction is scheduled to start in 2023.
Governance.
Living good management.
"In addition to the environment and society, good governance plays an increasingly important role in the perception and valuation of companies."
"For UBM, good governance means being viewed as a trustworthy and reliable partner by our stakeholders."
That is the foundation of our business success.
UBMs values competent.
"To ensure that our values are lived throughout the entire company and reflected in our employees everyday activities, our actions are based on ethical principles, relevant national and inter-national legal norms, and internal guidelines."
Importance of the issue Compliance with regulatory requirements and voluntary standards is an important part of responsible management.
"The construction and management of properties produces social benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, but also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous substances into the environment which, in turn, increases the pressure on (local) public authorities."
The relevance of compliance and compliance management systems has increased significantly in recent years for many different reasons.
"On the one hand, due to numerous new legal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties and, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming more and more consequent."
Violations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-cant risk for companies but are also connected with personal consequences for individuals.
"Companies can face fines, pen-alties and civil claims by damaged parties."
"In many cases, that can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the companys reputation."
"In addition to various sustainable finance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-ity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-sifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and strengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory Board (Sustainable Corporate Governance) to include man-datory human rights and environmental due diligence."
"Companies that fail to meet environmental standards or ethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial markets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and financial stability."
"Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, EU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to meet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of transparency."
"Our commitment Responsible actions start at an individual level but, as a company, we have a duty and responsibility to create the necessary framework."
"UBM does this, for example, through transparent internal directives and a code of conduct, com-mitment to various corporate governance guidelines and the UN Global Compact, and an effective internal compliance management system."
Responsible and transparent management has top priority for UBM.
"Compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, guidelines, standards and norms in the countries where UBM is active goes without saying."
The high demands we set for ourselves also apply to our business partners and employees.
"UBMs business model is oriented on ecological, social and ethically correct business practices."
"In order to strengthen the integration of ecological and social responsibility along the entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural requirements."
UBMs focus markets are strictly regulated and controlled legal areas with high human rights standards.
"Nonetheless, violations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and respect for human rights is therefore anchored in internal guidelines."
"We are committed to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact which, for example, prohibit child labour and forced labour."
"Our codes of conduct (ethic code and code of conduct for business partners) require guarantees for fair compensation, workplace safety, support for equal opportunity and the freedom of association, for example."
"Our responsible and transparent management is based on the following cornerstones: Austrian Code of Corporate Governance UBM, as an international listed company, has pledged its commitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a voluntary guideline for good management and control."
The company has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-nal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions.
The compliance management system implemented by UBM is intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal regulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-tions.
A compliance management system manual details the responsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation as well as the processes which implement the related rules and guidelines.
The Management Board and Supervisory Board consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-sequent implementation of all compliance principles.
"Our approach follows the principle of prevention disclosure reaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect behaviour."
"The trust of employees, business partners, customers and other stakeholders is strengthened by UBMs focus on trans-parency, anti-corruption, fair business practices, the pre-vention of money laundering and data protection."
Internal guidelines and work instructions form the framework for the necessary procedures examples are: Consequent compliance with applicable national and inter-national legal norms as well as our ethical principles safe-guards the trust of our stakeholders.
We are non-partisan and do not make any donations to political parties.
Guideline: Cartel and Competition Law Agreements and coordinated actions with third-party com-panies that lead to or aim to lead to the restriction of competition are prohibited and will not be tolerated by UBM.
"Guideline: Anti-corruption UBM employees are prohibited, without exception, from accepting or granting monetary gifts."
Material gifts to employees of public organisations are also prohibited with-out exception.
"Work instructions: Signatures All correspondence with a legally or commercially binding content as well as orders for goods or services must, in prin-ciple, be signed by two persons (dual control principle) who are specifically authorised or designated."
"Guideline for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing and work instructions: Prevention of Money Laundering Before a business relationship begins, its purpose and the identity of the business partner or ownership structure for legal entities must be precisely identified and regularly mon-itored."
The principle here is know your customer.
Work instructions: Data Maintenance 360 Data maintenance and consequent data entry are essential for the correct performance of our systems.
Further informa-tion on the 360 process landscape can be found on page 97.
Conflicts of Interest UBM employees must make sure their own interests do not come into conflict with their professional obligations or coun-ter UBMs obligations towards its business partners.
The reporting of potential violations is in the interest of the Management Board as well as the management of the Group companies.
In Data protection UBM is committed to the confidential and responsible handling of personal data in agreement with the applicable data pro-tection laws above all the EU Data Protection Regulation and related national legislation.
"Secure handling is guaranteed by a data protection manual that includes rules for internal data processing, work procedures and their monitoring."
Regular employee training and surveys create a greater awareness of this sensitive issue and make sure data protec-tion does not drift out of focus.
"Ethics code A separate, binding ethics code forms the basis for all busi-ness activities and decisions."
"It is the foundation for moral, ethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-ees and is designed to prevent mistakes."
"The values and principles contained in the code are based on national and international laws and requirements and on agreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-ness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-tional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation (in particular the Fundamental Principles of the IAO)."
"The subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among others, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-tal and human rights, working conditions, occupational safety and health, environmental protection, the prevention of money laundering, and data protection."
The last update was completed in December 2021.
Further information on the ethics code can also be found on our website under the menu item ESG.
"Code of conduct for business partners We not only place high priority on responsible actions by all UBM employees, but also set high standards for our busi-ness partners."
A separate code of conduct for our business partners is firmly anchored in our corporate processes and regularly adapted to reflect developments in the business and regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic val-ues.
The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and included requirements for all business partners to strengthen the integration of ecological and social responsibility along the entire value chain.
"This code is based on the same principles and regulations as the ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamental and human rights, working conditions, occupational safety and health, environmental protection, the prevention of money laundering, and data protection."
The code of conduct applies to all business part-ners who sell their products or services to UBM.
"If a business partner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated contracts will not be signed and the compliance officer is immediately informed."
He will then decide together with the Management Board on further procedures.
"In the event the code is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable measures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-sion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with the business partner."
Further information on the code of conduct for business part-ners can be found on our website under the menu item ESG.
Works Council UBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected every four years.
"Four of these members are delegated to the Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the votes."
UBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the respective national frameworks as well as representation on the Supervisory Board.
The Works Council also takes part in collective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with UBMs approval.
The newly founded ESG Committee also includes one member from the Works Council.
"During the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or violations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBMs oper-ating locations or suppliers."
Transparent processes UBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which go beyond legal requirements.
These processes are opera-tionally standardised through an institutionalised 360 prin-ciple.
"More specifically: As part of the Next Level efficiency programme, all core and support processes for project devel-opment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates and ultimately defined for the entire company."
"Roles and responsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and the control mechanisms were revised and improved."
These procedures and rules give employees the corresponding tools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design of processes and controls.
"We are convinced that these types of work instructions, guidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-munication and documentation, and help to make processes more efficient."
They also make effective controls possible.
"UBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-ance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and to quickly identify and correct any weak points in business and organisational processes, on the other hand."
The internal control system and internal audit Our internal control system (ICS) is an integral part of our business processes.
"Maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes Identify risks at an early point in time Reliably assess potential risks Monitor compliance with legal requirements Ensure the efficient use of resources and cost savings In addition to the controls in core processes, UBM has installed commercial and technical controlling functions."
Both report directly to the Management Board.
"Commercial controlling monitors the ongoing development of business to identify deviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes certain management receives the necessary information."
"Technical controlling monitors project development with a focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-gress and all processes important for technical realisation."
"Organisational structure Compliance management at UBM is installed in the legal, corporate and compliance department, which is also respon-sible for the content of the related guidelines."
A compliance officer and deputy were appointed by the Management Board of UBM AG.
The compliance guidelines are prepared by the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-ment Board and communicated to all employees.
All UBM employees have digital access to these guidelines.
The compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines and is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes in legal regulations.
The compliance guidelines are reviewed annually by the compliance officer.
"Risk analyses, reviews and internal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of the compliance management system."
The key positions in the internal data protection organisation are the data protection coordinator and one data protection officer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-ment Board.
The data protection guideline calls for the instal-lation of a data breach response team for the management and reporting of data protection violations in agreement with the data protection guideline.
A money laundering officer has also been appointed.
"As part of KYC reviews (know your customer), he compares the data received with sanction lists, entries in the register of economic owners, etc."
Additional information on the KYC reviews can be found on page 100.
The respective organisational units implement the individual internal guidelines and work instructions.
For example: The managing directors of the country organisations are respon-sible for the operational implementation and control of work instructions related to the code of conduct and ethics code.
The quality management department is responsible for pro-cedural instructions and documents related to the 360 pro-cess landscape as well as the coordination of and support for regular audits and confirmation through ISO certificates.
"GRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3 Supervisory Board self-evaluation The Supervisory Board carried out a self-evaluation of the efficiency of its activities, above all the organisation and work-ing procedures, during 2021 in accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance."
Goals and measures Goals from our sustainability programme: Code of conduct for business partners Code of conduct for employees Goals and measures in detail: Safeguard entrepreneurial compliance and responsible actions Fair business practices and zero tolerance for any form of cor-ruption these principles are a fixed part of our business cul-ture.
We have implemented the following measures to support this approach and anchor these principles in our company.
"There were no confirmed cases of corruption, proven money laundering incidents or other violations of rules and regu-lations that would have led to fines or non-monetary sanc-tions in 2021 or 2020."
"Furthermore, there were no confirmed cases where contracts with business partners were cancelled or not extended due to violations involving corruption, and no confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of employees due to corruption."
"There were no proceedings for anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-ination incidents."
Whistleblower system The whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover violations of data protection regulations and other report-able incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937.
It will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports in connection with UBMs ethics code and made available in Czech and Polish.
"The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-tified under the international quality management norm ISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022."
This cer-tification covered 62% of UBMs workforce in 2021.
Remuneration model The possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model will be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in managements variable remuneration over the medium term.
"Implement guidelines and prevent misconduct by consequent preventive activities Employee training The goal of training is to create a greater awareness among employees for potential sources of risk and, in this way, prevent corruption and anti-competitive behaviour."
New employees receive training from the compliance depart-ment immediately after they join UBM.
"Regular e-learning programmes cover compliance with guidelines on different subjects like the anti-corruption guideline and the guide-line on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to ensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, and the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-pliance guideline to prevent market abuse."
Most of the classroom training on compliance regulations has been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
A total of 174 employee training courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance issues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money laundering) were held in 2021.
"The compliance team frequently visits training courses, and there are additional certifications for selected responsibilities (for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified as a compliance officer under ISO )."
The procedure for the distribution of relevant corporate guidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022.
Employ-ees will be notified separately of any relevant changes in existing guidelines.
Ethics code The ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees in their national language.
"It was adapted in 2021 to meet our sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-gration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, the focus on human rights and environmental protection was reinforced."
"Increased awareness of the importance of ESG is also supported by company events and training (like the Climate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the green."
The compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-itor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider information and confidential and price-sensitive information.
Additional clarification briefings are held if necessary.
Prevent money laundering and terrorism financing KYC review of new business partners Know your customer is one of the basic principles underly-ing the guideline for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing and the work instructions on money laundering prevention.
Full transparency is guaranteed by requiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate disclosure form.
Special focus is placed on transactions and the acquisition and sale of apartments.
The money laundering officer uses special procedures to review all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-dering.
Over 250 business partners were extensively reviewed in 2021.
Internal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing UBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of its commercial activities.
"The related activities are classified internationally as having an increased risk of money launder-ing, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated regularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing."
The risk analysis for all Austrian subsidiaries which have registered brokerage as one of their commercial activities was updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the respective trade authority.
"Sustainable procurement & regional added value Increasing regulations in various European countries require the implementation of corporate due diligence procedures in supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and traceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent processing."
"The regulation is addressed to direct upstream suppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first step, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire upstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials producers) and the related working conditions and human rights situation."
Goals and measures in detail: Ensuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the value chain Compliance with social and ecological criteria in the sup-ply chain is a key factor for UBMs sustainable procurement.
"Preference should be given to regional sup-pliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost and time savings, protection for local jobs)."
"Last, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have created a greater awareness of the importance of the local economy."
"As a major customer for construction companies, planners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-nificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto says Think global, order local."
"Regional business partners, meaning companies near the respective locations, play an important role in the realisation of projects."
That creates jobs and regional added value directly at UBMs project locations.
Regional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation.
"On the one hand, local companies are supported and, on the other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes that reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of larger components."
"UBM created jobs and added value with this project, directly as well as indirectly."
This code is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values.
The last update was made in December 2021.
A technical solution for compliance documentation is currently in preparation and will be implemented in 2022.
The documentation of subcon-tractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed through sampling beginning in 2022.
"In Germany, a subcon-tractor management system will be introduced in 2022."
A procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen ecological and social responsibility along the supply chain.
"It defines standardised criteria and requirements for the ecologically oriented procurement of office and advertising materials, catering and hospitality."
"For example, the selection of an organic fruit supplier for UBMs headquarters in Vienna now ensures deliveries based on seasonal and regional factors."
Daily meals for employees are also supplied by a delivery service that provides organic foods.
"UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-ment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-logical, economic and socio-cultural aspects."
"This is under-scored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification of most of our commercial projects including residential construction in the future based on recognised sustainability seals like DNGB, GNI, LEED or BREEAM."
The green.
"In line with the above-mentioned management approach, the green."
It is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that covered several months and the entire workforce in 2020.
The focus was placed on the following seven core issues which were defined in a dialogue between the Management Board and Executive Committee: These certifications also involve external experts and auditors to confirm the relevant quality level for building materials.
"Minimising the environmental impact of a building during its entire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating energy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning stage."
The economic dimension covers the construction costs as well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire usage period or lifetime of the building.
"Innovation & technologies Internal and external research activities and innovations for sustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value chain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are considered."
These activities are focused on the following: Ideas and concepts were developed for these core areas as answers to the challenges created by climate change.
"The prevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building materials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-gration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-words."
"The areas of Design & Construction, Energy and Build-ing Operations, in particular, offer green starting points."
The goals for green building certification were also reset.
"As in the past, all new commercial buildings will be certified."
"Digitalisation of the UBM working world The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of the central role played by digitalisation in keeping the economy, educational system and society running smoothly during the lockdowns."
UBM has made massive investments in the Groups digitalisation in recent years and plans to continue these efforts in the future.
UBM launched the Next Level project in 2017 to digitally map operating and work processes as well as reporting and controlling at corporate level.
"The newBM project started in 2020 and is intended to move digitalisation at UBM a great qualitative leap forward, especially in the commercial areas but also in IT and infrastructure."
The newBM project included the development of an SAP S/4 HANA system based on standard processes and SAP best practices for 250 companies.
"A modern system supports the full digital management of HR processes, and a central treas-ury system safeguards the encrypted, safe and integrated handling of payment flows throughout the Group."
"The IT con-version also includes the latest IT equipment and is focused on productivity, security and flexible working."
"GRI 2-23, 2-25 Moreover: The certification of two listed revitalisation projects continued in 2021 and will be completed shortly Certification has focused since 2021 not only on commercial projects but also on all new residential construction projects scheduled for global sales Quarter certification is targeted with the LeopoldQuartier as a flagship project The core issues of User Services, Technology & Data and Mobility are designed to make UBMs real estate develop-ment intelligent through the use of technological solu-tions and, as a result, improve and individualise the user ex- perience."
"As early as the planning stage, UBM ensures that buildings are equipped for future smartness trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) or sensors and can be adapted accordingly."
"Future-oriented mobility concepts will also play a role in quar-ter development projects through the interaction of e-mo-bility, shared services and intelligent parking concepts."
The needs of users and the local environment can therefore be met with the highest possible level of efficiency and resource protection.
"In order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM cre-ated the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022."
This non-profit foundation provides a platform for partners from industry and science to develop technical application solutions for smart buildings.
About this report This report is UBMs second ESG report and fifth sustainability report.
It provides information on the 2021 financial year of UBM Development AG.
"UBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which was based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)."
"In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled in a more compact non-financial statement that was part of financial reporting and the annual report."
The report for 2020 was prepared in agreement with the GRI standards Core Option.
This report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-ance with 267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021.
The finan-cial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar year and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December.
The next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-tion on the 2022 financial year.
The report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant for UBM.
These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-lowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-ments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021.
The new pres-entation of information from previous reports is documented in the footnotes beginning on page 112.
"The reported indi-cators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019."
The management of UBM Development AG is responsible for preparation of the report content.
An external review with limited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125).
"If you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please feel free to contact UBM at Current information on sustainability can also be found on our website under the menu item ESG."
"Gender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-sible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no distinction was made between the genders."
"In the sense of equal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to all genders."
"Scope of consolidation This report covers the corporate locations, standing assets and development projects of UBM Development in Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets."
"In the hotel business, which was a focal point of activities before the strategic reorientation, UBM took over the role of the lessee in selected cases following the sale of the respective properties."
"The hotel leasing business was bun-dled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and UBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today."
"Large, international hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-ational management of these houses, whereby preference is given to partners who are aware of their ecological and social responsibility and have appropriate certification."
"This report does not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel operating company, which represents an equity-accounted investment, because UBM is unable to control the related measures and guidelines."
"The indicators in the section on the environment cover all companies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all Group locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and projects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-ber 2021."
ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and improved.
The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based primarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database (v14) to achieve consistency and actuality.
"Where actual consumption figures are not available, esti-mates are used (mainly for project development, where the energy consumption is calculated as per certificates)."
