The same applies \\nto the topic of sustainability. While others talk, we set \\nactions into motion. Bold visions and distant targets are \\nfine\\u2009and\\u2009good,\\u2009because\\u2009they\\u2009provide\\u2009orientation.\\u2009However,\\u2009\\nwhat\\u2009really\\u2009matters\\u2009is\\u2009that\\u2009we\\u2009make\\u2009an\\u2009effective\\u2009contribu-\\ntion to environmental and climate protection here and now. \\nBecause the only way to realise grand visions like that of \\na climate-neutral Europe in 2050 is by implementing con-\\ncrete measures today.\\n\\nSustainability is not just a trend for us. \\nIt is a call to action.\\nFor us it’s about thinking and acting beyond today for \\ntomorrow. This can be seen in our Sustainable Value Report \\n2019.\\u2009We\\u2009have\\u2009already\\u2009fulfilled\\u2009almost\\u2009all\\u2009the\\u2009\\u2009sustainability\\u2009\\ntargets that we set in 2012 for 2020\\u2009or\\u2009are\\u2009in\\u2009the\\u2009final\\u2009stretch\\u2009\\ntowards achieving them.\\n\\nOur road to sustainable mobility: \\nwe plan to meet Europe’s CO2 requirements \\nfor 2020 and 2021.\\nA major focus of our sustainability strategy is lowering \\nCO2 emissions. In recent years, we have steadily reduced \\nthe CO2\\u2009emissions\\u2009 of\\u2009 our\\u2009vehicle\\u2009 fleet\\u2009 and\\u2009achieved\\u2009a\\u2009\\ndecrease of around 40 per cent between 1990 and 2019. In \\n2020, we will once again lower our carbon emissions in \\nEurope\\u2009\\u2009significantly,\\u2009with\\u2009a\\u2009decrease\\u2009of\\u2009around\\u200920 per cent \\nfrom  the  previous  year.  This  means  we  plan  to  meet \\nEurope’s ambitious CO2 targets for 2020 and 2021. One \\n\\nOliver Zipse\\n\\nChairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n·\\n\\nPreface\\nAn overview of the BMW Group\\nKey sustainability indicators\\nTransformation of the BMW Group\\n\\n1\\nFundamentals\\n\\n2\\nProducts and services\\n\\n3\\nProduction and \\nvalue creation\\n\\n4\\nEmployees and society\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nfactor in achieving this is to inspire more customers to \\ndrive electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. This accounts \\nfor about two-thirds of the reduction. The remaining third \\nwill\\u2009come\\u2009from\\u2009further\\u2009efficiency\\u2009measures\\u2009for\\u2009our\\u2009conven-\\ntional engines.\\n\\nWe have a clear e-mobility roadmap.\\nA quarter of the vehicles we sell in Europe should be elec-\\ntrified\\u2009by\\u20092021; a third in 2025 and half in 2030.\\n\\nIn 2019, we delivered over 146,000 electric vehicles and \\nplug-in hybrids to customers worldwide. That means we \\nnow\\u2009have\\u2009a\\u2009total\\u2009of\\u2009more\\u2009than\\u2009half\\u2009a\\u2009million\\u2009electrified\\u2009vehi-\\ncles on the roads across the globe. However, it is also clear \\nthat people all over the world will continue to buy vehicles \\nwith a conventional engine.\\n\\nFor many people worldwide, it is still the best choice for \\ntheir individual mobility needs. It is precisely because we \\ntake\\u2009climate\\u2009protection\\u2009so\\u2009seriously\\u2009that\\u2009we\\u2009have\\u2009taken\\u2009Effi-\\ncient Dynamics to the next level by making our conven-\\ntional engines systematically even more accomplished.\\n\\nEffective climate protection cannot be \\nachieved with bans.\\nWe\\u2009will\\u2009continue\\u2009to\\u2009offer\\u2009our\\u2009customers\\u2009a\\u2009wide\\u2009range\\u2009of\\u2009\\ndrive\\u2009technologies,\\u2009where\\u2009they\\u2009can\\u2009choose\\u2009between\\u2009differ-\\nent drive trains in all relevant vehicle segments – accord-\\ning to their mobility needs and desires. This gives our cus-\\ntomers\\u2009the\\u2009“Power\\u2009of\\u2009Choice”.\\n\\nFrom production to recycling: we take a \\nholistic approach.\\nOur understanding of sustainability is not limited to reduc-\\ning\\u2009the\\u2009emissions\\u2009of\\u2009our\\u2009vehicle\\u2009fleet.\\u2009Our\\u2009sights\\u2009are\\u2009focused\\u2009\\non the entire value chain. In our supply chain, for  example, \\nwe have created a high level of transparency.  Moreover, our \\n\\nsuppliers must commit to the BMW Group’s high sustain-\\nability standards. We support them, for instance, by sour-\\ncing cobalt and lithium directly and making it available to \\nour partners, starting 2020. Since 2017, all BMW Group \\nlocations in Europe have obtained their externally pur-\\nchased electricity exclusively from renewable sources; from \\n2020, all BMW Group locations worldwide will do the same. \\nThis shows our full commitment to sustainability across \\nthe company.\\n\\nThe BMW Group is driving active \\nenvironmental protection.\\nWe\\u2009were\\u2009the\\u2009first\\u2009automobile\\u2009manufacturer\\u2009to\\u2009appoint\\u2009an\\u2009\\nenvironmental\\u2009officer\\u2009in\\u2009our\\u2009organisation\\u2009back\\u2009in\\u20091973. \\nSince 2001, we have been committed to the UN Global \\nCompact and implement its ten principles at all our loca-\\ntions  worldwide.  The  fully-electric  BMW i3,  with  its \\n360-degree approach, has been a pioneer in sustainable \\nmobility since 2013.\\n\\nNow, we are going even further: we have set ourselves \\nambitious targets to successfully tackle a variety of new \\nchallenges. For this very reason, we have decided to fully \\nincorporate our sustainability strategy into the BMW cor-\\nporate strategy. This will fully ensure that the company’s \\nthinking and actions are aligned in a sustainable manner. \\nFor me, this is how environmental and climate protection \\ncan achieve a real impact – across the company and within \\nsociety.\\n\\nOliver Zipse\\n\\nChairman of the Board of Management of \\n\\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##6\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n·\\n\\nPreface\\nAn overview of the BMW Group\\nKey sustainability indicators\\nTransformation of the BMW Group\\n\\n1\\nFundamentals\\n\\n2\\nProducts and services\\n\\n3\\nProduction and \\nvalue creation\\n\\n4\\nEmployees and society\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nAN OVERVIEW OF THE BMW GROUP1\\nProfit before tax\\u200a2 \\nin € million\\n\\n7,118\\n\\n2019\\n9,627 \\n2018 \\n2  The figures for the previous year were adjusted in line with first-time \\n\\n10,675\\n2017\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\napplication of IFRS 16, see [6] in the Group Appendix of the \\nBMW Group Annual Report 2019.\\nResearch and development expenditure \\nin € million\\n\\n6,419\\n\\n2019\\n6,890 \\n2018 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6,108\\n2017\\n\\nBMW Group employees at year-end \\nin numbers\\n\\n133,778\\n\\n2019\\n134,682 \\n \\n2018 \\n•  GRI 102-2, 102-7\\n\\n129,932\\n2017\\n\\nVehicle deliveries* \\nin thousand units\\n\\n2,538.4\\n\\n2019\\n2,483.3 \\n \\n2018 \\n\\n2,468.7\\n2017\\n\\nCO2 emissions of BMW Group Automobiles \\n (EU-28) in g / km\\n\\n127\\n\\n2019 3\\n128 \\n2018 3 \\n3  adjusted value due to introduction of WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised \\n\\n128  \\n2017 3 \\n\\n122\\n2017 4\\n\\n \\n\\nLight Vehicles Test Procedure)\\n\\n4  using NEDC test procedure\\nInvestment in further education and training \\nin € million\\n\\n370\\n\\n2019\\n373 \\n2018 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n349\\n2017\\n\\n*  Delivery figures have been adjusted retrospectively going back to 2015.

The basis for the adjustments is a change in the methodology used to collate data for the BMW Group’s most important markets (China, \\n\\nUSA, Germany, UK, Italy and Japan). The retrospective adjustment enables better comparability. Additional information can be found in the Annex under “Additional information on delivery figures.”\\n\\n1  The figures for the previous financial year were adjusted due to a change in accounting methods when IFRS 16 was introduced, see [6] in the Group appendix of the Annual Report 2019. In addition, the figures for \\nthe previous year were adjusted due to the change in how selected topics that are of subordinate importance overall are posted.\\n2  Since 09 / 2018 all vehicles in the EU must be licensed according to the new WLTP test cycle. However, the calculation of CO2 emissions from fleet vehicles will only be switched to WLTP in 2021 by the European \\nCommission. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate WLTP fleet emissions back to NEDC values up to and including 2020 for reporting purposes. The changed WLTP test constraints lead to higher NEDC emissions \\n(NEDC correlated) due to the reversed calculations. In order to ensure comparability, the CO2 fleet emissions for 2017 (122 g / km NEDC) were converted to a correlated NEDC value of 128 g / km under WLTP test \\nconstraints and published originally with the 2 / 2018 quarterly report.\\n3  Adjusted value in line with planned change to WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure)\\n4  Calculated based on volumes of green energy purchased as well as the conservative calculation of country-specific energy shares from renewables purchased from third parties.

We have specific plans to help us achieve the 2020 goal in full. •  chapter 2.1\\n\\nThanks to our broad range of electrified vehicle products, the BMW Group is a market leader in \\nnew vehicle registrations in this field in Germany (based on total market share). In Europe: sec-\\nond (total market share); globally: third (premium segment). We therefore expect to achieve this \\ngoal by 2020 and have already announced further ambitious goals in addition. •  chapter 2.2\\n\\nIn recent years, we have begun to offer a number of urban mobility services (including a joint \\nventure with Daimler AG), making a positive impact on mobility patterns in selected cities. As a \\nresult, we expect to meet this goal in 2020. •  chapter 2.3\\n\\n \\n\\nThis goal has already been achieved in part. In terms of waste and solvents, we have already far \\nsurpassed the set goals as of 2019 (waste: – 78.4 %, solvents: – 66.1 %). As far as energy \\n(2019: – 40.4 %) and water (2019: – 28.8 %) are concerned, we are currently significantly \\nahead of our direct competitors based on their publicly accessible sustainability reports, \\nalthough we are still yet to reach the 45 % target. •  chapter 3.1\\n\\nBy 2018, our European plants were already powered by 100 % renewable energy or offsets were \\nmade to this effect. In 2020, we are aiming to reach this figure for all our plants worldwide. \\n•  chapter 3.2\\n\\nIn terms of transparency, we consider the target achieved, especially when it comes to critical \\nraw materials (such as cobalt). However, we still see a need for resource efficiency to be \\nimproved in 2020. •  chapter 3.3\\n\\n \\n\\nThe BMW Group has already achieved its self-imposed goal thanks to various measures in the \\narea of occupational safety. We expect this to continue in 2020. \\n•  chapter 4.1\\n\\nFrom the BMW Group’s perspective, this goal has already been achieved as of 2019. Evidence \\nfor this includes external studies on employer attractiveness and our in-house employee  survey. \\nIn 2020, we expect to continue meeting this goal. •  chapter 4.2\\n\\nThe global reach of the BMW Group is also reflected in the diversity of our workforce. The pro-\\nportion of women in management positions (17.5 %) is above our self-imposed target range. \\n•  chapter 4.3\\n\\nSince 2011, we have been able to reach more than 3.6 million people with our intercultural \\nunderstanding projects. •  chapter 4.4\\n\\nCombined separate non-financial report\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##13\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n1\\n\\nFundamentals\\n\\n·\\n\\n1.1  Strategy\\n1.2  Sustainability management\\n1.3  Stakeholder dialogue\\n1.4  Compliance and human rights\\n1.5  Product safety\\n\\n2\\nProducts and services\\n\\n3\\nProduction and \\nvalue creation\\n\\n4\\nEmployees and society\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nWe conduct materiality analyses on a regular basis to take \\naccount of ongoing developments.

It determines the strategic orientation of the enter-\\nprise and ensures its implementation. The Board of Man-\\nagement is also responsible for ensuring compliance with \\nall provisions of the law and internal regulations as well \\nas for adequate risk management and controlling. The \\nSupervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of \\nManagement in conducting its duties (dual management \\nsystem). •  GRI 102-18\\n\\nFollowing the restructuring of the BMW Group’s Corpor-\\nate Strategy division, there is now joint responsibility for \\nsustainability and mobility. This involves taking the changes \\nin mobility systems and their impacts on the BMW Group \\ninto account, analysing these changes and impacts in view \\nof requirements for doing business sustainably, evaluating \\nthese changes and impacts, and translating them into stra-\\ntegic assumptions for the company. At the same time, the \\noperational duties related to environmental management \\nsystem oversight at our various locations were transferred \\nto the relevant central department.\\n\\nThe Sustainability and Mobility department is under the \\ndirect organisational supervision of the Chairman of the \\nBoard of Management within the Corporate Strategy divi-\\nsion. This unit is responsible for global sustainability man-\\nagement. Its tasks include:\\n\\n–  Identifying challenges and opportunities for \\n\\n sustain able operations\\n\\n–  Developing and monitoring sustainability goals\\n–  Further developing, specifying and integrating \\n\\n sustainability into the individual divisions, taking \\nthe entire value chain into account\\n\\n–  Ensuring the cooperation of all departments in the \\n\\ncompany involved in sustainability\\n\\n–  Helping to deliver a sustainable mobility system, \\n\\nespecially in urban areas\\n\\nManaging sustainability on a long-term basis\\nThe Board of Management works to ensure that the Group’s \\nStrategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT is aligned with sustain-\\nability in the long term. The special-purpose Sustainabil-\\nity Board was fully involved in regular Board of Manage-\\nment meetings in 2019, allowing sustainability issues to be \\neven more consistently integrated into the company’s deci-\\nsion-making processes. Since then, sustainability issues \\nhave been treated like every other topic and discussed as \\nneeded at fortnightly Board of Management meetings.

Besides buyer’s \\npremiums and reduced taxes, examples of these include \\nexceptions to potential traffic restrictions as well as prefer-\\nential treatment in lane usage and parking concessions for \\nelectrified  vehicles.  We  respond  to  the  growing  envir-\\nonmental awareness of many customers by expanding our \\nportfolio of low-emission, efficient vehicles. They can select \\nthe right drivetrain technology for their mobility needs \\nthanks to our Power of Choice concept. \\n \\n \\nBy taking measures to reduce the emissions of CO2 and \\npollutants, we act in line with the UN Sustainable Devel-\\nopment Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good health and well-being), 9 \\n(Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 (Responsible \\nconsumption and production) and 13 (Climate action).\\n\\nLowering emissions with efficiency technologies and \\nsolutions for pollutant reduction\\nIn our conventional drive vehicles, we currently achieve \\nthe\\u2009most\\u2009effective\\u2009impact\\u2009on\\u2009lowering\\u2009CO2 and pollutant \\nemissions\\u2009through\\u2009our\\u2009efficiency\\u2009technologies\\u2009and\\u2009through\\u2009\\nspecific\\u2009solutions\\u2009for\\u2009pollutant\\u2009reduction.\\n\\nThe BMW\\u2009Group\\u2009is\\u2009continuing\\u2009to\\u2009concentrate\\u2009its\\u2009efforts\\u2009on\\u2009\\nreducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

This is reflected again and again in our dialogue with \\nstakeholders. Our electrified vehicles\\u200a1 combine the advan-\\ntages of sustainable mobility and technological conveni-\\nence. Fully electric battery models (BEV) have zero local \\nemissions and can significantly reduce traffic noise in cit-\\nies. Compared to the conventional drivetrain technology, \\nthey  have  a  more  efficient  electric  engine  and  quicker \\nacceleration. This means that we can offer our customers \\nan entirely new driving experience. \\n \\n \\nWe intend to set standards in electromobility and contrib-\\nute towards fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement. To \\nunderline our claim to leadership, we are aiming to contin-\\nually increase the sales of our electrified vehicles by 2025. \\nBy 2021, we are planning to more than double sales com-\\npared to 2019. By taking measures to further enhance elec-\\ntromobility, we are contributing to the UN Sustainable \\nDevelopment  Goals  (SDGs)  7  (Affordable  and  clean \\nenergy), 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 \\n(Sustainable cities and communities), 12 (Responsible con-\\nsumption and production) and 13 (Climate action).\\n\\n• see \\nchapter 1.1\\n\\n1  The term “electrified vehicles” has varying definitions in the automotive industry. \\n\\nThe BMW Group defines these as fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that can be \\ncharged and driven purely electrically.\\n\\nAchieving sustainability over the entire life cycle\\nFrom the very beginning of the BMW i project, we have \\nbeen\\u2009one\\u2009of\\u2009the\\u2009first\\u2009manufacturers\\u2009to\\u2009pursue\\u2009the\\u2009goal\\u2009of\\u2009\\nconsistently reducing the emissions of CO2 and other pol-\\nlutants over the entire life cycle. We are continuously work-\\ning on this. As most of the CO2 emissions emitted by BEVs \\narise from the manufacture of the essential components, \\nwe rely on renewable resources\\u2009and\\u2009highly\\u2009resource-effi-\\ncient and environmentally friendly production processes.\\n\\nAnother decisive factor is the use of renewable energy \\nsources in the BMW value chain: from the manufacture of \\nenergy-intensive materials such as CFRP\\u2009(carbon\\u2009fibre\\u2009rein-\\nforced polymer), to vehicle production and the BMW Green \\nEnergy\\u2009package\\u2009we\\u2009offer\\u2009our\\u2009customers\\u2009when\\u2009they\\u2009pur-\\nchase their vehicle.\\n\\nOther approaches include the recycling and reuse of bat-\\nteries, for example in stationary storage units for improved \\nuse of renewables.\\n\\nImproving range and expanding our vehicle portfolio\\nA key challenge for the success of electromobility is improv-\\ning the range of our vehicles. For example, we increased \\nthe range of the BMW X5 PHEV\\u200a2 from 31 km (2015, accord-\\ning to the NEDC cycle) to 80 km3, the BMW 530e PHEV\\u200a2 \\nfrom 45 km (2017, according to the NEDC cycle) to 60 km3, \\nthe BMW 330e PHEV\\u200a2 from 40 km (2016, according to the \\nNEDC cycle) to 60 km\\u200a3 and the BMW i3 BEV\\u200a2 from 300 km \\n(2016, according to the NEDC cycle) to 359 km4.

The focus is always on our brand \\npromise of driving enjoyment. This has become a chal-\\nlenge, especially in densely populated urban spaces, but \\nalso on the motorways around large cities. By 2030, a pro-\\njected 60 % of people worldwide will live in cities. \\n \\n \\nThe related increase in traffic volumes often goes hand in \\nhand with a significant rise in noise and air pollution, con-\\nsumption of space as well as increased risk of accidents. \\nWe are proactive in taking these challenges into account \\nas we develop our networked vehicles and mobility ser-\\nvices. Our measures are designed to contribute to UN Sus-\\ntainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 (Industry, innova-\\ntion and infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and com-\\nmunities) and 13 (Climate action). \\n \\n \\nThe technological shift towards electrification, digitalisa-\\ntion and new mobility services is fundamentally changing \\nthe  sector.  The  integration  of  cars  into  a  multimodal, \\nincreasingly  digitally  networked  mobility  ecosystem  – \\nespecially in urban areas – represents a great entrepre-\\nneurial challenge. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nUp until 2019, the BMW Group focussed on expanding its \\ncar-sharing services in cities in Germany, Europe and the \\nUSA.  In  2019,  mobility  services  were  strategically \\nreviewed and then reoriented. This involved the merging \\nof  a  broad  spectrum  of  mobility-related  services  with \\nDaimler AG under YOUR NOW (car-sharing, taxi\\u200a/\\u200aride \\nhailing, charging and parking).  \\n\\nKey measures:\\n\\nImproving urban quality of life with networked and auto-\\nmated driving\\nAutomated and digitally networked vehicles have the poten-\\ntial\\u2009to\\u2009significantly\\u2009reduce\\u2009the\\u2009frequency\\u2009of\\u2009traffic\\u2009jams,\\u2009\\nlower the risk of accidents, reduce emissions and improve \\nthe quality of life in cities.

We continuously convert new \\ninsights into mandatory standards. There are also clear \\nguidelines for information and data protection for cooper-\\nation and partner relationships.\\n\\nWe introduced BMW CarData in Germany in 2017 and \\nthen in Europe the following year. This is a service that \\ngives our customers the option of deciding about the utili-\\nsation and transmission of data from vehicles to third par-\\nties in compliance with data protection legislation. We now \\nwant to establish this service in other core markets such \\nas the USA.\\n\\nProviding services for more sustainable mobility \\nIn addition to our highly automated vehicles, we plan to \\nprovide our customers with mobility in a seamlessly net-\\nworked, sustainable ecosystem consisting of car-sharing, \\nride-hailing, parking, charging and multimodality.\\n\\nFor this purpose, we merged our mobility services with \\nthose of Daimler AG in a joint venture in 2019. The joint \\nventure comprised the following activities and services: \\nREACH  NOW  (multimodal  and  on-demand  mobility), \\nSHARE NOW (car-sharing), FREE NOW (ride-hailing), \\nPARK NOW (parking) and CHARGE NOW (charging). \\nBMW Group subsidiary Digital Charging Solutions, founded \\nin 2017,\\u2009also\\u2009offers\\u2009other\\u2009OEMs (Original Equipment Man-\\nufacturers) access to the CHARGE NOW network as a prod-\\nuct\\u2009–\\u2009the\\u2009first\\u2009customer\\u2009was\\u2009the\\u2009PSA Group.\\n\\nDue diligence processes:\\n\\nTaking changes in urban mobility patterns into account \\nat an early stage\\nThe BMW Group has pooled the issue of changes in  mobility \\nsystems in its corporate strategy and analysed the result-\\ning opportunities and challenges together with the issues \\nof sustainability. The role of the car in the transport sys-\\ntem of the future, particularly in urban areas, is one of the \\ngreatest challenges for the future of the car and is addressed \\naccordingly by the BMW Group, along with the reduction \\nof the CO2 emissions and the sustainability of supply chains. \\nTrends in the main markets are analysed very closely.\\n\\nIn order to understand changes, impacts and needs of urban \\nmobility patterns worldwide in good time, the BMW Group \\ntakes part in projects focused on dialogue, initiators and \\nresearch.

For supplying our Chinese \\nplants, for example, the Trans-Siberian Railway is used as \\nan alternative to air transport, resulting in a reduction of \\nCO2 emissions in the region of 56,000 t. In addition, more \\nthan 50 % of vehicles produced leave the BMW Group plants \\nby rail. Furthermore, since the US Continental Distribu-\\ntion Center in Lower Nazareth opened in 2019 we have \\nbeen able to cut down on overseas transports and procure \\nmore material locally in the NAFTA area. \\n\\nAs part of the Green Logistics Strategy 2050, we are con-\\ntinuously developing environmentally sustainable logistics \\nconcepts in collaboration with freight forwarders, infra-\\nstructure operators and producers of commercial vehicles. \\n\\nImplemented projects include a total of nine electric lor-\\nries, which are used in plant logistics.

Therefore, we are working closely \\nwith our direct suppliers in order to make our supply chains \\nmore transparent. •  GRI 102-9\\n\\nEstablishing sustainability firmly within the \\nsupplier network\\nAs one of the pioneers in the automotive sector, we have \\nmade sustainability an integral part of our procurement \\nprocess and an essential purchasing criterion since 2014. \\nOur sustainability requirements apply to all suppliers of \\nproduction materials as well as service providers. In turn, \\nthey are also obliged to forward these requirements to their \\nsub-suppliers.\\n\\nWe identify raw materials and other materials that are par-\\nticularly critical in terms of sustainability. We analyse the \\nimpact of these resources on the environment and society \\nalong the entire supply chain, develop raw\\u2009material-\\u2009specific\\u2009\\nhedging strategies and carry out pilot projects to increase \\nsustainability performance.\\n\\n• see other \\n strategically \\n relevant topics\\n\\nIn order to ensure an active transformation towards a sus-\\ntainable supplier network, we seek close collaboration with \\nour suppliers and are committed to their further develop-\\nment in all aspects of sustainability.

Lithium is mined \\nfrom hard rock, for example in Australia, as well as from \\nbrine deposits, for example in South America. There is \\nsome criticism in particular with regard to brine  production \\namid concerns about local groundwater.\\n\\nIn order to further increase traceability within the supply \\nchain, BMW has decided to purchase lithium directly, start-\\ning\\u2009with\\u2009the\\u2009fifth\\u2009generation\\u2009of\\u2009battery\\u2009drives.\\u2009We\\u2009will\\u2009then\\u2009\\nmake the lithium available to our partners in the supply \\nchain, in the same way as we do with cobalt. We intend to \\nsource  100 % of the lithium hydroxide needed for the \\nhigh-voltage batteries in our vehicles in this way. When \\nprocuring the material, we will continue to ensure that any \\neffects\\u2009on\\u2009the\\u2009groundwater\\u2009are\\u2009kept\\u2009to\\u2009a\\u2009minimum.\\n\\nCopper\\nWith\\u2009the\\u2009electrification\\u2009of\\u2009our\\u2009fleet,\\u2009the\\u2009demand\\u2009for\\u2009copper\\u2009\\nis also on the rise, since large amounts of the material are \\ncontained in the vehicles’ electrical systems as well as the \\nhigh-voltage battery and the drivetrain.

Together with our suppliers \\nDRÄXLMAIER Group and LEONI AG we have mapped \\nall steps in the supply chain and visited cable production, \\ncopper processing and mining locations. We are using the \\nresults from these activities to develop solutions in collab-\\noration with stakeholders from politics, society and  industry.\\n\\nNatural rubber\\nFostering sustainability in the natural rubber supply chains, \\na raw material which is mainly used in tyre products, is \\nalso particularly important to us. The BMW Group has \\nbeen seeking opportunities for dialogue and collaboration \\nwith the relevant stakeholders in this sector for several \\nyears. In March 2019, a collaboration between all parties \\ninvolved in the processing of natural rubber was success-\\nfully established and, at a founding meeting in Singapore, \\nthe independent •  Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber \\n(GPSNR) was set up. The foundation of the GPSNR was ini-\\ntiated by the management of the •  World Business Council for \\nSustainable Development (WBCSD) •  Tire Industry Project (TIP).

Our occupa-\\ntional health and safety concept therefore includes a holis-\\ntic health management programme, occupational safety \\nand ergonomics, ageing-appropriate work systems and a \\nwide variety of healthy food in our canteens. \\n \\n \\nThe right to health and safety at the workplace is a key com-\\nponent of our • BMW Group Code on Human Rights and Working \\nConditions. In it, the BMW Group undertakes to consistently \\ncomply with the currently applicable occupational health \\nand safety legislation worldwide and in addition to set its \\nown standards for improving occupational safety. •  GRI 403-1 \\nThese programmes also help us contribute towards achiev-\\ning the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) num-\\nbers 3 (Good health and well-being) and 8 (Decent work \\nand economic growth).\\n\\nKey measures:\\n\\nAn extensive management system for occupational safety \\nand protection of health forms the basis of our activities in \\nthis area.

The programme is designed to strengthen \\neach and every employee’s sense of individual responsibil-\\nity and to provide a work environment that meets the \\nrespective requirements for optimal health and perform-\\nance. Employees who voluntarily take part in the pro-\\ngramme undergo a health check and answer questions \\nregarding their work environment, after which they receive \\nan extensive personal medical report and have the option \\nof consulting a physician for advice on any preventive meas-\\nures required. The participating employees’ departments \\nalso receive a consolidated report laying out the relevant \\nhealth aspects and information on how to structure the \\nworking\\u2009environment.\\u2009While\\u2009they\\u2009do\\u2009not\\u2009allow\\u2009identifica-\\ntion of any individual person, these reports do help to deter-\\nmine general areas for improvement. In Germany, for \\ninstance, we had invited around 85,000 employees to the \\nprogramme between 2014 and the end of 2019 and had \\ncompiled over 35,000 individual reports and around 850 \\nreports for departments. •  GRI 403-2, 403-3\\n\\nIt is of particular importance to us that all our employees \\nhave access to our health services.

The \\nSafety and Ergonomics Risk Assessment (SERA) is the tool \\nused to assess risks in production and production-related \\nareas. This was rolled out throughout the BMW Group \\nfrom 2016 onwards. Today, we use SERA at twelve manu-\\nfacturing and non-manufacturing sites.\\n\\nIt is of the utmost importance to us that all third-party com-\\npanies that are present at the BMW Group locations also \\nwork as safely as possible. Safe collaboration with contract-\\nors is regulated by the contractor declaration, which deter-\\nmines\\u2009risks\\u2009and\\u2009derives\\u2009protective\\u2009measures\\u2009from\\u2009the\\u2009first\\u2009\\nday  of  work  onwards.  In  addition,  BMW  provides  all \\nemployees of external companies who are working on the \\nlarge construction sites with safety instructions delivered \\nby specialists, above and beyond the statutory stipulations \\n(on smaller construction sites this is the task of the exter-\\nnal company). The contracting departments must monitor \\ncompliance with the occupational safety stipulations them-\\nselves.

The Expert Career programme is in prin-\\nciple open to all employees and is not limited to selected \\nspecialist departments or divisions.

At \\nthe BMW Group, institutionalised co-determination is \\nimplemented  Group-wide  according  to  the  applicable \\nnational regulations.

This also includes the right to establish \\nand to join independent trade unions and other advocacy \\norganisations as well as protection against discrimination \\non the grounds of membership in an employee represent-\\native body. Freedom of association is thus one of the prin-\\nciples set down in the •  Joint Declaration on Human Rights and \\nWorking Conditions at the BMW Group.

On January 22, 2020, \\nthe SEC formally opened an investigation into potential \\nviolations of U.S. securities laws by BMW Group relating \\nto disclosures regarding BMW Group’s unit sales of new \\nvehicles. The BMW Group is reviewing the matter and \\ncooperating with the SEC’s investigation. Information on \\ncontingent liabilities is provided in note 38 to the Group \\nFinancial Statements in the annual report.\\n\\nThe preparation of BMW Group’s retail vehicle  delivery \\ndata involves estimates and judgments and is subject to \\nother uncertainties, including:\\n\\n–  The vast majority of deliveries of vehicles are carried \\nout by independent dealerships or other third parties, \\nand BMW Group is reliant on such third parties to \\ncorrectly report relevant data to BMW Group.\\n\\n–  In\\u2009addition,\\u2009the\\u2009definition\\u2009of\\u2009deliveries\\u2009includes\\u2009any\\u2009\\nvehicles delivered in the United States or Canada if:\\n–  the relevant dealers designate such vehicles as \\n\\n service loaner vehicles or demonstrator vehicles \\n(BMW\\u2009Group\\u2009provides\\u2009financial\\u2009incentives\\u2009in\\u2009\\nthis regard to such dealers); or\\n\\n–  such vehicles are company vehicles purchased \\n\\nby dealers or other third parties at auctions or by \\n dealers directly from BMW Group,\\n\\neach of which may not correlate to a sale to a consumer or \\nother end user in the relevant reporting period.\\n\\nRetail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period \\ndo not correlate directly to the revenue that BMW Group \\nrecognises in respect of such reporting period.\\n\\nFor\\u2009the\\u2009definition\\u2009of\\u2009deliveries\\u2009see\\u2009below*.\\n\\nIn connection with reviewing its sales practices and related \\nreporting practices, BMW Group also reviewed prior period \\nretail vehicle delivery data and separately determined that \\ncertain vehicle deliveries were not reported in the correct \\nperiods. The BMW Group has revised the data on those \\nvehicle deliveries that had not been reported in the correct \\nperiods as further described below, and is making, and will \\ncontinue to make in the future, certain adjustments to its \\npolicies and procedures in order to improve the reliability \\nand validity of its retail vehicle delivery data, in particular \\nwith respect to the timing of the recognition of deliveries.\\n\\nSpecifically,\\u2009the\\u2009retail\\u2009vehicle\\u2009delivery\\u2009data\\u2009presented\\u2009in\\u2009\\nthe annual report (years 2015 through 2019) and in this \\nSustainable Value Report have been revised by adjusting \\nthe data for BMW\\u2009Group’s\\u2009six\\u2009most\\u2009significant\\u2009markets\\u2009to\\u2009\\nreflect\\u2009the\\u2009above.\\u2009In\\u2009the\\u2009years\\u20092015 through 2019, these six \\nmarkets (China, USA, Germany, UK, Italy and Japan) rep-\\nresented on average 68.3 % of BMW Group’s total vehicle \\ndeliveries. For each of the years 2015 through 2019, these \\nrevisions amounted to less than 1 % of BMW Group’s total \\nretail vehicle deliveries. The retail ve hicle delivery data for \\nBMW Group’s other markets have not been adjusted, as \\nBMW Group believes the impact to be immaterial.\\n\\nWhile BMW Group believes the retail vehicle delivery data \\npresented in the annual report and in this Sustainable \\nValue Report to be materially correct in accordance with \\nBMW\\u2009Group’s\\u2009definition\\u2009of\\u2009deliveries,\\u2009challenges\\u2009and\\u2009fur-\\nther revisions of such data cannot be ruled out.\\n\\n*  Deliveries: A new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed over to the end user \\n\\n(which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the \\nUS and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a  service \\nloaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they  purchase a \\ncompany vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles  directly from \\nBMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a \\nBMW Group retail outlet, or independent third party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – \\nand hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries – is made by independent third party deal-\\ners. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the rev-\\nenue that BMW Group recognises in respect of such reporting period.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##140\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n1\\nFundamentals\\n\\n2\\nProducts and services\\n\\n3\\nProduction and \\nvalue creation\\n\\n4\\nEmployees and society\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nOur reporting concept\\nTCFD Index\\nFuel consumption and \\nCO2 emissions ratings\\nAdditional information on \\ndelivery figures\\nIndependent Practitioners’ \\nLimited Assurance Report\\nImprint\\n\\n·\\n\\nINDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS’ LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT\\nIndependent Practitioner’s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Non-financial Reporting and Sustainability Information\\n\\nPractitioner’s Responsibility\\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Sus-\\ntainability Information and the information contained in the Non-financial \\nReport and highlighted in color before the respective chapters in the Sus-\\ntainable  Value  Report  based  on  the  assurance  engagement  we  have \\nperformed. \\n\\nWithin the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on  external \\nsources of in-formation or expert opinions, referred to in the Sustainable \\nValue Report.\\n\\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the Interna-\\ntional Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assur-\\nance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor-\\nmation, issued by the IAASB.
