Details of Executive Directors employment arrangements can be found in the Directors Remuneration Policy on page 195.,0
"Compensation of Directors and Senior Management During the year ended December 31, 2021, Shell paid and/or accrued compensation totalling $48 million (2020: $36 million) to Directors andSenior Management for services in all capacities while serving asaDirector or member of Senior Management, including $3 million (2020:$3million) accrued to provide pension, retirement and similar benefits.",0
"Relative importance of spend on pay The table below sets out distributions to shareholders by way ofdividendsand share buybacks, and remuneration paid toorreceivablebyemployees for the last five years, together withannualpercentage changes.",0
Workforce engagement The REMCO bases its decisions about remuneration on a wide range of factors including a careful consideration of the pay and conditions of the general workforce.,0
"The planned general employee salary increases in the UK, USA and the Netherlands (when the REMCO was reviewing 2022 base salaries and target remuneration packages).",0
"Executive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with Shells broader policy on pay: In recent years the Group scorecard architecture has been identical tothe Executive Committee and Senior Executive scorecard in terms ofmeasures, weightings and targets.",0
This consistency means that less explanation of executive remuneration structures is required than in companies where alignment is not the default practice.,0
"The Directors Remuneration Policy as detailed on pages 189-197 took effectfrom May 19, 2020, after it was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM.",0
Scorecard targets will be disclosed in the subsequent Directors Remuneration Reportwhen they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive.,0
"The Directors Remuneration Policy sets out: A summary of proposed changes to the Directors RemunerationPolicy, page 189; Executive Directors Remuneration Policy, pages 190-196; and Non-executive Directors Remuneration Policy, pages 196-197.",0
"This section describes the Directors Remuneration Policy (Policy) which, following shareholder approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM), came into effect from May 19, 2020, and will be effective until the2023 AGM, unless a further policy is proposed by Shell plc (the Company) and approved by shareholders in the meantime.",0
"The principles underpinning the REMCOs approach to executive remuneration are the foundation for everything we do, and are: Alignment with Shells strategy: the Executive Directors compensation package should be strongly linked to the achievement of stretching targets that are seen as indicators of the execution of Shells strategy; Pay for performance: the majority of the Executive Directors compensation, (excluding benefits and pensions), should be linked directly to Shells performance through variable pay instruments; Competitiveness: remuneration levels should be determined by reference internally against Shells Senior Management and externally against companies of comparable size, complexity and global scope; Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares inShell; Consistency: the remuneration structure for Executive Directors should generally be consistent with the remuneration structure for Shells Senior Management.",0
The REMCO also seeks to ensure compliance with applicable laws and corporate governance requirements when designing and implementing policiesand plans; and Risk assessment: the remuneration structures and rewards should meetrisk-assessment tests to ensure that shareholders interests aresafeguarded and that inappropriate actions are avoided.,0
The Executive Directors remuneration structure is made up of a fixed element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus (50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP).,0
"During 2018 and 2019, the REMCO reviewed the Remuneration Policy toensure that the Policy continues to be aligned with Shells strategy, including delivery of shareholder returns.",0
"REMCO determined that while the current policy remains appropriate in many respects, certain changes will support the REMCO to simplify remuneration structures and address the management of quantum.",0
Remuneration element Annual Bonus Proposed Changes to Policy Reduction of the CEOs target bonus from 150% to 125%; and Removal of the individual performance factor for Executive Directors.,0
"Discretion, Malus and Clawback Pension After reviewing the single figure outcomes for the year, the REMCO will consider an adjustment for the purposes of managing remuneration quantum, taking into account performance, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations.",0
An explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report; Alignment of malus and clawback provisions so that these are the same.,0
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Executive Directors remuneration policy table Purpose and link to strategy Maximum opportunity Salary and pensionable base salary Provides a fixed level of earnings to attract and retain Executive Directors.,0
"In making salary determinations, the REMCO will consider: the market positioning of the compensation packages; comparison with Senior Management salaries; the employee context, and planned average salary increase for other employees across the Netherlands, the UK and the USA; the experience, skills and performance of the Executive Director, or any change in the scope and responsibility of their role; general economic conditions, Shells financial performance, and governance trends; the impact of salary increases on pension benefits and other elements of the and package.",0
"This balance ensures that the achievement of short-term financial performance does notundermine future shareholder value creation; Scorecard targets will be disclosed in a subsequent Directors Remuneration Report when they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive; There are no prescribed thresholds or minimum levels of performance that equate toaprescribed payment under the Policy and this structure can result in no bonus being awarded; The annual bonus is subject to malus provisions before it is delivered and to clawback provisions thereafter; The REMCO retains the ability to adjust performance measure targets and weightings year-by-year within the overall target and maximum payouts approved in the Policy; and In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the REMCO will determine their target and maximum bonus, which will not exceed the target andmaximum for the CEO.",0
"This would be done at the REMCOs discretion after considering single figure outcome for the year, taking into account Shells performance, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations.",0
"The REMCO retains the right to amend the form of any Executive Directors pension arrangements where appropriate, for example in response to changes in legislation to ensure the original objective of this element of remuneration is preserved.",0
The comparator companies are reviewed by the REMCO as part of the Remuneration Policy review every three years.,0
The last review took place in 2019 in preparation for the 2020 Directors Remuneration Policy vote.,0
The REMCO uses benchmark data from these companies only as a guide to the competitiveness of the remuneration packages.,0
We do not seek to position our remuneration atany defined point against the benchmarked positions.,0
"These elements may include transport to and from home and office, the provision of home security, and occasional business-required partner travel, which are generally considered legitimate business expenses rather than components of remuneration.",0
"In years where the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration inappropriate for any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to the annual bonus outcome or the LTIP vesting outcome forthe purposes of managing remuneration quantum.",0
"In making any adjustment to the annual bonus or LTIP vesting outcome for this purpose REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, as well as the internal context for other employees.",0
An explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report.,0
Shareholding is one of Shells core remuneration principles as it creates a balanced connection between individual wealth and Shells long-term performance.,0
"Differences for Executive Directors from other employees The remuneration structure and approach to setting remuneration levels is consistent across Shell, with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities.",0
"However, a higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for Executive Directors and members of Senior Management.",0
"The salary for each Executive Director is determined based on the indicators in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table, which reflect the international nature of the Executive Directors labour market.",0
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued Executive Directors retirement benefits are maintained in line with those ofthe wider workforce in their base country.,0
The REMCO determines the remuneration package for new Executive Director appointments.,0
"When determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to: attract and motivate candidates of the right quality; take into account the individuals current remuneration package andother contractual entitlements; seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, without overpaying; encourage relocation if required; and honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal candidates before their promotion to the Board.",0
The REMCO will follow the approach set out in the table below when determining theremuneration package for a new Executive Director.,0
"The charts on this page represent estimates under four performance scenarios (Minimum, On-target, Maximum and Maximum, assuming a 50% share price appreciation between award and vest) ofthe potential remuneration outcomes for each Executive Director resulting from the application of 2020 base salaries to awards made in accordance with the proposed Policy.",0
"The majority of Executive Directors remuneration is delivered through variable pay elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching targets.",0
"The REMCO will review the formulaic Single Figure outcome relative to thequality of performance outcomes and adjust these, taking into account Shells performance, shareholder experience, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant factors, to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only achieved in years with the highest quality performance.",0
The scenario charts are based on future Policy award levels and are combined with projected single total figures of remuneration.,0
"Compensation for the forfeiture ofany awards under variable remuneration arrangements Recruitment Remuneration package Approach Component The salary, benefits, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension benefits will be Ongoing remuneration positioned and delivered within the framework of the Executive Directors remuneration policy.",0
"To facilitate external recruitment, one-off compensation in consideration for forfeited awards under variable remuneration arrangements entered into with a previous employer may be required.",0
The REMCO will use its judgement to determine the appropriate level of compensation by matching the value of any lost awards under variable remuneration arrangements with the candidates previous employer.,0
This compensation may take the form of a one-off cash payment or an additional award under the LTIP.,0
The compensation can alternatively be based on a newly created long-term incentive plan arrangement where the only participant is the new director.,0
"Theintention is that any such compensation would, as far as possible, align to the duration and structure of the award being forfeited.",0
There may also be a need to compensate a new Executive Director in respect of forfeitedentitlements other than any awards under variable remuneration arrangements.,0
"Onrecruitment, these entitlements may be replicated within the Executive Directors remuneration policy or valued by the REMCO and compensated in cash.",0
"In cases of internal promotion to the Board, any commitments made which cannot be effectively replaced within the Executive Directors remuneration policy may, at the REMCOs discretion, continue to be honoured.",0
Maximum As stated in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table.,0
"An amount equal to the value of the forfeited variable remuneration awards, as assessed by the REMCO.",0
Subject to the limits set out in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table.,0
"The Netherlands statutory end-of-employment compensation With effect from July 1, 2015, employment legislation in the Netherlands introduced statutory end-of-employment compensation.",0
"Under this legislation, every termination (other than following retirement or for cause)of a Dutch employment contract that has continued for a minimum of two years will give rise to an obligation to pay the departing employee transition compensation (transitievergoeding).",0
"The statutory compensation is capped at one times the annual salary, which is deemed to include variable pay such as the annual bonus.",0
Executive Directors are expected not to claim transition compensation or any other applicable statutory compensation over and above the agreed compensation for lossof office as set out in the End of employment table on page 196.,0
"In cases of resignation or dismissal for cause, fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits, and employer pension contributions) will cease on the lastday of employment, variable remuneration elements will generally lapse and the Executive Director is not eligible for compensation for lossofoffice.",0
"DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued End of employment Provision Compensation for loss of office Annual bonus LTIP Policy For Executive Directors appointed between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016, employment contracts include a cap ontermination payments of one times annual pay (base salary plus target bonus).",0
Delivery of compensation is mitigated by acontractual obligation for the Executive Director to seek alternative employment and Shells ability to implement phased paymentterms.,0
"However, REMCO may be obligated to pay statutory compensation over and above the compensation for loss of office to a departing Executive Director who asserts a statutory claim thereto.",0
Delivery of compensation ismitigated by a contractual obligation for the Executive Director to seek alternative employment and Shells ability to implement phased payment terms.,0
"The REMCO may adjust the termination payment for any situation where a full payment is inappropriate, taking into consideration applicable law, corporate governance provisions, the applicability of any statutory compensation and the best interests of Shell andshareholders as a whole.",0
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Other remuneration Business expenses incurred in respect of the performance of their duties as a NED will be paid or reimbursed by Shell.,0
"The Chair and the other NEDs cannot receive awards under anyincentive or performance-based remuneration plans, andpersonal loans or guarantees are not granted to them.",0
Non-executive Directors remuneration policy table Fee structure Non-executive Directors (NEDs) receive a fixed annual fee for their directorship.,0
Non-executive Director recruitment The REMCOs approach to setting the remuneration package for NEDs is to offer fee levels and specific benefits (where appropriate) in line with the Non-executive Directors remuneration policy table and subject to the Articles of Association.,0
NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or retention awards.,0
Consideration of shareholder views The REMCO engages with major shareholders on a regular basis throughout the year and this allows it to hear views on Shells remuneration approach and test proposals when developing or evolving the Policy.,0
Recent examples of the REMCO responding to shareholder views include: considering the quantum of executive pay and the use ofalternative reward structures; introducing the Energy Transition metric tothe LTIP in line with our strategic ambitions; removing the individual performance modifier from the calculation of annual bonus outcomes tomake remuneration structures simpler and more transparent to shareholders; reducing the CEOs target bonus from 150% to 125%; reducing the CEOs LTIP grant; and enabling the broader use of discretionto manage remuneration outcomes.,0
"When determining Executive Directors remuneration structure and outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect of remuneration and average salary increases applying in the Netherlands, UK and the USA).",0
"The REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources &Corporate Officer and the Executive Vice President Remuneration and HR Operations on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration matters affecting other senior executives, extending to multiple levels below the Board and Executive Committee.",0
"When setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of the Shell Group, thecurrent balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans, andexisting commitments.",0

The unavoidable cost under a contract isthe lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation orpenalties arising from failure to fulfil it.,0

The NRC also reviews the compensation framework and remuneration for the CICT Groups executives and approves the specific remuneration packages for the key management personnel.,0
The remuneration framework and policy are designed to support the implementation of the CICT Groups business strategy and deliver sustainable returns to Unitholders.,0
"Corporate Governance Fair & Appropriate Ensure competitive remuneration relative to the appropriate external talent markets Manage internal equity such that remuneration is viewed as fair across the CICT Group Significant and appropriate portion of pay-at-risk, taking into account risk policies of the CICT Group, symmetrical with risk outcomes and sensitive to the risk time horizon Effective Implementation Maintain rigorous corporate governance standards Exercise appropriate flexibility to meet strategic business needs and practical implementation considerations Facilitate employee understanding to maximise the value of the remuneration programme These remuneration policies are in line with the CICT Groups business strategy and the executive compensation framework is based on the key principle of linking pay to performance, which is emphasised by linking total remuneration to the achievement of corporate and individual goals and objectives.",0
"The NRC considers all aspects of remuneration, including termination terms, to ensure they are fair, and has access to remuneration consultants for advice on remuneration matters as required.",0
"In reviewing policies on remuneration and determining the remuneration packages for key management personnel, the NRC, through an independent remuneration consultant, takes into consideration appropriate compensation benchmarks within the industry, so as to ensure that the remuneration packages payable to key management personnel are competitive and in line with the objectives of the remuneration policies.",0
It also considers the compensation framework of CLI as a point of reference.,0
"In FY 2021, Willis Towers Watson was appointed as independent remuneration consultant to provide professional advice on executive remuneration.",0
"Remuneration of Key Management Personnel Remuneration of key management personnel comprises fixed components, a variable cash component, Unit-based components and employee benefits.",0
"A significant proportion of key management personnels remuneration is in the form of variable compensation, awarded in a combination of short-term and long-term incentives, in keeping with the principle that the interests of the key management personnel should be aligned with those of Unitholders and that the remuneration framework should link rewards to business and individual performance.",0
The Manager believes that the Unit-based components of the remuneration for key management personnel serve to align the interests of such key management personnel with that of Unitholders and CICTs long-term growth and value.,0
"Coupled with interlocking annual grants, this ensures ongoing alignment between remuneration and sustainable business performance in the longer term.",1
"Each year, the NRC evaluates the extent to which each of the key management personnel has delivered on the business and individual goals and objectives, and based on the outcome of the evaluation, approves the compensation for the key management personnel.",0
"In such evaluation, the NRC considers whether the level of remuneration is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate key management personnel to successfully manage CICT for the long term.",0
The CEO does not attend discussions relating to his own performance and remuneration.,0
"Corporate Governance Unitholders due to the intense competition for talents in the industry, as well as the need to balance the confidential and commercial sensitivities associated with remuneration matters.",0
"The Manager is making available, however, the CEOs remuneration amount in a band of S$250,000 and the aggregate of the total remuneration of the other key management personnel (excluding the CEO) together with a breakdown of their respective remuneration components in percentage terms, which are set out in the Key Management Personnels Remuneration Table on page 203 of this Annual Report.",0
"The Manager is of the view that its practice of disclosing the aforementioned information and the other disclosures on this Report is consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the Code and provides sufficient information and transparency to the Unitholders on the Managers remuneration policies and the level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration and the relationship between remuneration, performance and value creation.",0
"In addition, the remuneration of the key management personnel is not borne by CICT as it is paid out of the fees that the Manager receives (the quantum and basis of which have been disclosed).",0
"In this regard, the remuneration of such Outsourced Personnel, being employees of the CLI Subsidiary and CLI Group, is not included as part of the disclosure of remuneration of key management personnel of the Manager in this Report.",0
"The Board, together with the NRC, seeks to ensure that the remuneration of the CEO and other key management personnel is strongly linked to the achievement of business and individual performance targets.",0
"In addition, such compensation is in the long-term interests of CICT as CICT is a key part of CLIs business and ecosystem (and it is also the largest Unitholder of CICT), and Managements actions to grow CICT and drive CICTs performance will also have a positive impact on CLI, thus reinforcing the complementary nature of the linked performance between CICT and CLI.",0
The cost of this one-time award will be borne by the Manager and it will not form a significant part of the key management personnels annual remuneration.,0
"In addition, as can be seen in the Key Management Personnels Remuneration Table for FY 2021, a proportion of the Managements remuneration is paid in the form of Units, which further incentivises the Management to take actions which are beneficial to the Unitholders.",0
"Accordingly, the Special PSP Award will not result in the Management prioritising the interest of CLI over that of CICT given that the bulk of their remuneration is determined based on the evaluation of the performance of CICT and a proportion of their remuneration comprises Units.",0
The Manager is required under the AIFMR to make quantitative disclosures of remuneration.,0

The compensation policy for non-executive Directors is based on a scale of fees divided into basic retainer fees for serving as Director and additional fees for attendance and serving on Board Committees.,0
"The remuneration of non-executive Directors is reviewed from time to time to ensure that it is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate the non-executive Directors to provide good stewardship of the Manager and CICT.",0
No individual Director is involved in any decision of the NRC relating to his or her own remuneration.,0
"As with previous years, an independent remuneration consultant, Willis Towers Watson, was engaged in FY 2021 to provide professional advice on Board remuneration, with a view to ensuring the fee structure remains in line with market.",0

"The Nomination and Compensation Committee regularly benchmarks the practices of companies comparable in size and activities to Klpierre, notably to verify (i) the appropriateness of Executive Board member compensation with regard to the Groups size and to Board members experience as well as (ii) the competitiveness of the compensation offered to Executive Board members versus the benchmark.",0
"In view of the results of the study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee in January/February 2022 (detailed below) and the recent departure of a member of the Executive Board to manage another company in the industry, the Nomination and Compensation Committee felt it was appropriate to recommend to the Supervisory Board that it establish the components of compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board that would represent the compensation policy applicable for fiscal year 2022, taking into account certain changes in relation to the policy applicable for fiscal year 2021 which were approved by the Supervisory Board: Maintain the current compensation structure based on three components: Fixed compensation, determined on the basis of the responsibilities of the Chairman and of the other members of the Executive Board, which must be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain the best talent, Short-term variable compensation, the aim of which is to associate the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board with the Groups short-term performance, and Long-term incentives, to align the interests of the beneficiaries as closely as possible with the interests of shareholders, with a view to creating long-term value; Maintain (practically unchanged) the maximum total compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board.",0
"Positioning of Executive Board member compensation in light of reference panels To ensure a consistent approach, the benchmark study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee to verify the market positioning of the compensation of the Executive Board members was based on the same two panels as those used during the previous changes in the compensation policy that took place in 2019: a panel of 40 SBF 120 companies centered around Klpierres last The charts below show that the 2022 compensation levels for executive corporate officers as submitted to the vote of the General Meeting are consistent with Klpierres positioning (in terms of its market capitalization) within the reference panels selected.",0

"In respect of 2021: variable compensation is determined using (i) a quantitative objective of net cash flow per share, one of the key indicators used by the Group in its communications with the markets, and (ii) a qualitative component based on specific objectives set for each Executive Board member.",0
"The quantitative portion can represent up to 80% of fixed compensation, and the qualitative portion up to 50%.",0

In respect of 2022: the value of long-term variable compensation is reduced to 100% of short-term compensation.,0
"In exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board, having solicited the opinion of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, may exercise its judgment to adapt and/or amend the performance criteria and/or the calculation scale (upwards or downwards) used to determine the short-term variable compensation of the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board in the event that the impact of such circumstances were disproportionate with regard to the fundamental principles of the compensation policy.",0
"Exceptional circumstances that may give rise to the use of this faculty include any exogenous event that could not reasonably have been taken into consideration or quantified at the time the compensation policy was set, such as the Covid-19 health crisis and subsequent developments, and any events with a comparable impact on Klpierres business.",0
"Should a new Chairman of the Executive Board be appointed, the principles and criteria provided for in the last compensation policy approved by the General Meeting would also apply to that person.",0
"In such cases, acting on the recommendation of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the Supervisory Board will, in light of existing practices and based on the situation of the executive concerned, determine the different components of compensation, which shall a) Fixed annual compensation for fiscal year 2022 not exceed those set out in said policy.",0
"To summarize, Jean-Marc Jestins compensation is typically split into equal portions between the fixed component (including benefits in kind), the short-term variable component and the long-term variable component.",0
"The Chairman of the Executive Boards compensation includes the following components: The fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Executive Board for fiscal year 2022 is set at: 750,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of his termination or re-appointment in 2022; and 825,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period between the date of his re-appointment in 2022 and December 31, 2022.",0

Qualitative component Weighting Capped at 50% of fixed annual compensation.,0
"Description The qualitative portion of variable compensation is measured by applying several criteria and for 2022 is based around the following topics: Promotion of CSR; Strategy implemented to enhance the quality of the portfolio (developments, investments, disposals); Risk management; Management of human capital.",1
The overall short-term variable compensation paid to the Chairman of the Executive Board is capped at 150% of his fixed annual compensation as stated in the 2022 compensation policy.,0
