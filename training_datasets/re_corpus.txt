"Additionally, companies in the non-bank financial services sector, such as investment management, hedge funds and private wealth could also be major demand drivers for leasing in Grade A offices.", "While work from home was the default work arrangement for most firms in 2021, the challenge would be for occupiers to calibrate their space requirements between adopting a hybrid working model and encouraging employees back to the office.", "In the case of the latter, the creation of safe and conducive environments that promote camaraderie, company culture and innovation will be amongst the priorities of firms.", "Many firms will also be likely to incorporate technology tools into their business operations as part of their growth objectives as they move towards a new normal in 2022 and

are well supported by a working population and an immediate residential catchment.", "While mixed-use developments typically comprise a residential component in addition to a commercial component,

have high-quality green features and open spaces for the community; and offer value-added services for tenants and other stakeholders21.", "Integrated developments are becoming more popular, evident

developments.", "Within decentralised locations, the office component benefits from being a part of an integrated development, particularly where quality stock is limited.", "An enhanced accessibility to amenities and connectivity to transport nodes contribute to the premium observed by integrated developments, 21 Includes integrated services across different parts of the integrated development, tenant offers and events, access to certain privileges such as discounts and updates, and the use of other facilities and amenities within the larger integrated development.", "Independent Market Review especially over Grade B standalone offices in the decentralised areas.", "However, in the CBD Core, premiums are largely dependent on the quality of the building, location and proximity to amenities.", "As most office buildings in the CBD Core have high specifications and are well located with convenient access to transport nodes and surrounding amenities, these developments, be it integrated or standalone, would share a premium over Grade B buildings in the same area.", "For the retail component, an important advantage of integrated developments would be the presence of a local catchment.", "This could include office workers, residents, hotel guests or serviced apartment residents.", "Landlords of integrated developments also tend to be more active in place-making

19,000 sq m in light of further significant withdrawals of about 268,000 sq m in 2022/2023 for Metro acquisition and redevelopment.", "In terms of new supply, the large supply pipeline is mainly contributed by Quay Quarter Tower (75,000 sq m), Salesforce Tower (55,000 sq m), and three over-station developments at Martin Place (two towers totalling 105,000 sq m) as well as Parkline Place (48,000 sq m).", "These developments will come onstream between 2022 and 2024.", "Besides the large supply pipeline, there was also an increase in supply of office stock in the sublease market in Sydney CBD due to a combination of new work from home trends and cost-cutting by businesses.", "As of December 2021, CBRE recorded approximately 99,000 sq m sublease availability but this amount was significantly lower than the previous peak of 170,751 sq m registered in November 2020.", "Sydney CBDs sublease market is expected to decline steadily throughout 2022, supported by strong leasing activity and over 90% of the sublease spaces being within prime assets with good quality fit-out, as well as the ongoing flight-to-quality trend.", "This will be underpinned by improving tenant demand coupled with subdued supply in 2022/2023 and about 60% of the confirmed supply completing between 2022 and 2024 being pre-committed.", "In 2021, occupiers were more active in the leasing market by evolving their real estate portfolios to be ready for a post-pandemic environment.", "This was unlike 2020, when many occupiers without a hard deadline had paused their corporate real estate strategy as businesses reassessed their future office space requirements.", "Tenant demand continued to recover in H2 2021, recording 7,812 sq m of positive net absorption.", "This represents total net absorption of 33,111 sq m and the strongest since 2015.", "Additionally, supporting the strong performance was the record level of 543 leasing briefs received by CBRE Leasing in 2021, whilst enquiry volumes had also reached a new high of approximately 536,000 sq m since 2014.", "Over a quarter of the enquiry volume originated from Business Services (29%), followed by Financial and Insurance Services (19%) and Technology & IT Services (10%).", "Whilst all size groups recorded a significant uptick in briefs received, particularly to the sub-3,000 sq m tenants, total briefs received had doubled over the last 12 months.", "The strong uptick in leasing sentiment coincides with the improved occupier sentiment towards the long-term expansion plan.", "Independent Market Review over the next three years to 2023 and over half of the respondents expect to increase the use of collaborative space including meeting rooms and communal space to facilitate the larger volume of team and

momentum into 2022.", "However, net effective rental23 has continued to fall throughout the year, primarily driven by incentives remaining at historically high levels above 30%+ for prime and secondary offices.", "With market sentiment continuing to improve, supported by underlying indicative data such as record-high enquiry level and improving office fundamentals, the growth rate of

environment and a flight-to-quality trend.", "In contrast to a pre-pandemic level where foreign investment represented an average of 37% of total transaction volumes between 2015 and 2019, activity in 2021 was driven largely by local institutional investors across the listed wholesale and private investor markets.", "Following the trend of falling bond yields, prime office yields in Sydney have

Market Overview The North Sydney office market lies across the harbour of the north of Sydney CBD.", "The two markets are connected by the Harbour Bridge and an underground rail line.", "In 2024, the new Victoria Cross Station Metro rail line will provide a further connection between the two markets, with an estimated travel time of just under 6 minutes to the CBD.", "This enhanced connectivity between the two office markets is expected to benefit North Sydney as an agglomerated office market, supporting future rent growth and increased value.", "Similarly, employment in North Sydney was impacted by COVID-19.", "Demand and Supply As of January 2022, the North Sydney office market consists of 922,793 sq m of office stock, making it the second-largest office market in metropolitan Sydney.", "Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of the North Sydney office market consists of secondary grade stock, accounting for about 60% of the total stock.", "Significantly, of the 109 buildings currently surveyed by PCA, only about 16 existing buildings have floorplates greater than 1,000 sq m in size across all grades.", "However, these projects are not due to complete until 2023/2024.", "Though there are approximately 430,000 sq m of mooted projects, these projects are unlikely to commence without any precommitment.", "With the majority of the future stock being prime grade, this will continue to narrow the spread between prime and secondary grade stock, offering a more balanced asset profile in North Sydney.", "The rejuvenation of office stock will also enhance the appeal of North Sydney and contribute to the evolution of tenant composition.", "Over the six months to July 2021, North Sydney was the only metro market in Sydney to have recorded positive net absorption of 776 sq m and the strongest net absorption of 13,070 sq m over the 12 months to July 2021.", "Moreover, a limited supply pipeline over the next 12 months will help absorb the impact of COVID-19-related vacancy, with total vacancy forecasted to trend downward closer to the long-term average of 8% by the end of 2022.", "The tenant profile of North Sydney is dominated by the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services industry.", "North Sydney has been identified as a preferred location as tenants seek to attract and retain talented staff with the lure of excellent transport connectivity, abundant facilities and amenities, as well as the availability of brand-new office accommodation with up to a 30% parity to CBD rents.", "This is supported by the high level of new demand recorded over the past 18 months to July 2021, with 2020 recording 42,420 sq m of net tenant movements relocating to North Sydney.", "The chart shows the breakdown of tenant relocation from other major markets into North Sydney and new office or business setup since 2020.", "On the other hand, incentives also increased 300 bps to 35% over the same period for prime and secondary.", "The gap between North Sydney and CBD prime rents has narrowed appreciably since 2008.", "North Sydney prime grade rents are currently about one-third of Sydney CBD prime office rents.", "This has supported the increasing attractiveness of secondary CBD locations as an alternative to North Sydney.", "Looking forward, while net supply additions remain low over the next 12-18 months, we expect North Sydney to perform similarly to the CBD, with falling effective rents to bottom out in 2022 as tenant demand continues to strengthen.", "Consistent with this, incentives eased to approximately 33% from 35% a year ago.", "Whilst transactions were more modest in 2021, with about A$442 million transacted across five assets largely due to limited stock available in the market, offshore demand remains significantly strong.", "Of the five assets transacted, offshore investment contributed about 62% of the total transaction volume, above the 10-year average of 53%.", "We expect prime yield to remain relatively stable, while modest yield compression is expected in secondary yield over 2022/2023.", "Further yield compression, albeit slight, may provide greater scope for secondary asset

fluctuation in the carrying amount of the Groups net investment in its foreign subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Netherlands.", "As at reporting date, the Groups net investment in its foreign subsidiaries is hedged by a number of EUR-denominated unsecured bank loans of carrying amount of $497,776,000 (2020: $517,183,000), which mitigates the foreign currency risk arising from the subsidiaries net assets.", "The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2021 is $497,501,000 (2020: $519,497,000).", "These loans are designated as a hedging instrument for the changes in the value of the net investment that is due to changes in the EUR/SGD spot rate.", "It does not include fair value information for financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.", "Their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.", "The fair values of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps (Level 2 fair values) are based on banks quotes.", "These quotes are assessed for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date.", "Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Group and counterparties when appropriate.", "The fair values of forward exchange contracts are determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curve in the respective currencies.", "Financial instruments that are not measured at fair value Other non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value at initial recognition and for disclosure purposes, at each annual reporting date.", "The fair value of quoted loans and borrowings is their quoted ask price at the reporting value for unquoted loans and

the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.", "The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property.", "Typically, the Group assesses the acquisition as a purchase of business when the strategic management function and the associated processes were purchased along with the underlying property.", "Following the acquisition, CCT became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust.", "Included in the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition of CCT are inputs, processes and an organised workforce.", "The Group has determined that together the acquired inputs and processes significantly contribute to the ability to create revenue.", "The Group has concluded that the acquired set is a business.", "As a result, the Group also consolidated RCS Trust.", "Prior to

to invest in income producing real estate which are used or substantially used for commercial purposes to achieve an attractive level of return from rental income and for long-term capital growth.",

other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and other current liabilities.", "The fair value of these assets and liabilities are assessed to approximate the carrying amounts since they are short term in nature.", "Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings consist of floating and fixed rate term loans and medium term notes.", "The carrying amount of floating rate loans and

loans is estimated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows at market rates as at the date of acquisition.", "The fair value of fixed rate medium term notes has been determined

development are also appraised.", "The methods used by the property valuers primarily include the residual method and/or the discounted cash flow method, and also in certain cases the sales comparison

under development are valued on the basis of a clearly identified and approved project, as soon as the building permit can be processed and implemented.", "Regardless of the method used to determine their estimates, property valuers set a value and discount rate in line with the risks inherent in each project and, in particular, the state of progress of the various approval and construction stages (demolition permit, building permit, objections, stage of completion of work, any pre-commitment, or rent guarantee).", "From the exit value, the property valuers must explain which procedure they followed in estimating the degree of risk and the change in valuation for the building in the light of the circumstances under which they worked and the information made available to them.", "In

tenant.", "Three types of situations may arise: termination compensation is paid in order to vacate premises which require reconstruction or renovation; it is capitalised by including it in the cost of the related tangible assets; termination compensation is paid in order to vacate premises for a potential future tenant; it is recognised as an expense for the financial year in which it was incurred; termination compensation is paid due to advanced negotiations for the signing of a lease with a new tenant; it is capitalised and amortised over the lease term on the same basis as lease income.", "Government investment grants Government investment grants received are recognised in equity.", "These are recognised as income over the useful life of the depreciable asset.", "Indications of impairment include: a substantial decline in the market value of the asset; a change in the technological, economic or legal environment.", "An impairment loss is recognised where the assets recoverable amount is less than its net carrying amount.", "The recoverable amount of a property, as determined by independent property valuers, is the higher of the fair market value less disposal costs, and the value in use.", "The fair market value is the market value excluding duties.", "The value in use is the present value of expected lease income from those assets.", "Where the estimated recoverable amount is less than the net carrying amount, the difference between those two amounts is recognised as an impairment loss.", "Recognising an impairment loss entails a review of the depreciable amount and, as the case may be, of the depreciation schedule for the property concerned.", "Impairment tests take into account any technical merger deficits allocated to property assets and property rights recognised as intangible fixed assets.", "Impairment losses on property may subsequently be reversed if the recoverable amount again becomes higher than the net carrying amount.", "The value of the asset after reversal of the impairment loss should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.", "Although carried out by independent property valuers, it should be remembered that valuing a property asset is a complex estimation exercise, which is also subject from one year to the next to the changing economic climate and the volatility of some of the market parameters used, particularly yields and discount rates.", "Therefore, in order to take into account the inherent difficulties of valuing a property asset and to avoid recognising an impairment loss that might need to be fully or partially reversed in the next financial statements, Icade only recognises an impairment loss if the unrealised capital loss on the property assets is more than 5% of the net carrying amount before impairment.", "It is determined whether or not this threshold has been crossed for each individual asset or group of assets, where these assets are interdependent as, for example, in the case of business park assets.", "If this threshold is exceeded, the impairment loss recognised is the total amount of the unrealised capital loss.", "This impairment loss is adjusted upwards or downwards at each reporting date to reflect changes in the value of the asset and its net carrying amount, remembering that if the impairment loss is less than 5% of the net carrying amount before impairment, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.", "For properties acquired less than three months before the reporting date and recognised in the financial statements at their acquisition price including transfer taxes, the unrealised capital loss corresponding to transfer taxes and other acquisition costs is not recognised as an impairment loss.", "Capitalised borrowing costs The Company has elected to include borrowing costs directly attributable to construction or production in the cost of the corresponding asset.", "Borrowing costs are deducted from finance expenses and included in the construction costs up to the completion date of the works.", "Capitalised borrowing costs are determined as follows: where funds are borrowed in order to build a specific asset, the borrowing costs that are eligible for capitalisation are the costs actually incurred over the financial year less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings; where the borrowed funds are used to build several assets, the borrowing costs that are eligible for capitalisation are determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the construction costs.", "This capitalisation rate is equal to the weighted average of current borrowing costs for the financial year other than those of borrowings taken out for the purpose of building specific assets.", "The capitalised amount may not exceed the amount of costs actually borne.", "Equity investments, receivables associated with equity investments and other long-term securities Equity investments and other long-term securities are recognised as assets at acquisition cost, contribution or subscription value, excluding expenses.", "Receivables associated with equity investments are recognised at their nominal value.", "If the recoverable amount is lower than the net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised as a finance expense.", "Equity investments Subsequent to their purchase, equity instruments, whether listed or not, are measured based on their value in use.", "This value is primarily determined in accordance with the following criteria: the adjusted net asset book value and the profitability of the Company, estimated mainly by reference to the enterprise value net of financial liabilities.", "The enterprise value is calculated using the discounted cash flow method and, where appropriate, the multiples method.", "In the particular instance of the investment in Icade Promotion, the enterprise value is determined by an independent valuer based on a multi-criteria analysis.", "Investments in property investment companies are valued based on the net asset value including any unrealised capital gains or losses on property assets, measured using the fair values determined by independent property valuers.", "Receivables associated with equity investments

receivable.", "Assessment of the recoverability of receivables associated with equity investments in partnerships also takes into account the situation of the other partners.", "Other financial fixed assets For investments in listed companies, the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the average share price over the last month of the financial year.", "On an exceptional basis, some securities which do not have a quoted price in an active market and whose recoverable amount cannot be measured reliably, are maintained at acquisition cost.", "Inventories Inventories are recognised at acquisition or production cost.", "At each reporting date, they are valued at the lower of their cost and net realisable value.", "Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion or the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.", "Accounts receivable Accounts receivable primarily consist of short-term receivables.", "An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount.", "Accounts receivable are impaired on a case-by-case basis according to various criteria

result in an outflow of resources without an offsetting inflow at least equivalent, and the value of which can be estimated reliably.", "Identified risks of any kind, particularly operational and financial risks, are monitored on a regular basis, which makes it possible to determine the amount of provisions deemed necessary.", "Financial StatementS December 31, 2021 Accounting policies and

of contracts estimated at the reporting date and their nominal value are not recorded.", "Premiums paid when interest rate options are purchased are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of these instruments.", "When an instrument eligible for hedge accounting is unwound, two scenarios are possible: First case: the hedging instrument is unwound while the hedged item still exists.", "In this case, the termination payment made or received is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item, offsetting the gain or loss recognised for the hedged item itself; Second case: the hedging instrument is unwound and the hedged item is terminated.", "In this case, termination payments in respect of hedges are immediately recognised through profit or loss.", "Tax The Company is eligible for the tax regime for French listed real estate investment companies (SIICs, under Article 208 C of the French General Tax Code), which provides for an exemption from tax on net lease income and capital gains on disposal of investment property.", "In return for exemption from corporate tax, the application of the SIIC tax regime entails, among others, specific dividend payment obligations: 95% of profits from leasing activities; 70% of capital gains on disposals; 100% of dividends paid by subsidiaries which have opted for the SIIC tax regime.", "Furthermore, the Companys fiscal income is divided into two separate segments: a segment exempt from tax on current income from leasing activities, capital gains on disposals and dividends received from subsidiaries

between the assumptions used and reality, or changes in the assumptions used to measure the liabilities and the related plan assets: employee turnover rates; rates of salary increases; discount rates; mortality tables; rates of return on plan assets.", "Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as profit or loss for the financial year in which they are incurred.", "As accounting rules do not provide for a specific treatment in the event of legislative or regulatory changes impacting an existing plan, the Company elected to consider that such changes result in a change of plan and the impact is

of assessments Key audit matters Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions.", "Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects.", "Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies internal organisation and the performance of the audits.", "These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above.", "We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.", "Tangible fixed assets mostly comprise property assets held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation (or for both).", "Property assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment, which is determined based on their fair value.", "Management has implemented a process for determining the fair value of the investment property portfolio, based on valuations performed by independent external appraisers and supplemented by an internal valuation process.", "Measuring the fair value of a property asset is a complex exercise which involves making estimations.", "We deemed the valuation and impairment risk of tangible fixed assets to be a key audit matter due to the materiality of the corresponding amounts in the financial statements, the high degree of judgement and estimation involved in determining the main valuation assumptions used and the potentially high sensitivity of the tangible fixed assets fair value to these assumptions.", "Description of risk The Company holds shares in property development and property investment companies.", "After their acquisition, equity

determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser using mainly the discounted cash flow and comparable multiples methods.", "For both types of investments (and associated receivables), estimating their value in use requires in-depth knowledge of the property market.", "For property investment companies, it requires the same significant judgements as those described above under the Valuation and impairment risk of tangible fixed assets key audit matter.", "For property development companies, the judgements rely in particular on forecast data, such as business plans and discount rates.", "We deemed the valuation of equity investments and associated receivables to be a key audit matter due to the materiality of the corresponding amounts recognised in the financial statements, the high degree of judgement and estimation involved in determining the main valuation assumptions used and the potential significance of the sensitivity of the fair value of the related assets to these assumptions.", "How our audit addressed this risk We carried out the following procedures: verifying the appropriateness of the valuation methods used by management depending on the type of equity investment; comparing the carrying amounts of equity investments with the net asset values of the related companies; verifying, when applicable, the information used to estimate value in use; 6 for equity investments in property investment companies, on a sample basis: ensuring that the equity values used were consistent with the financial statements of the related entities valued, ensuring that any adjustments made to calculate the adjusted net asset value, in particular by taking into account any unrealised capital gains on investment property assets, were estimated based on the fair values determined by management with the assistance of external appraisers; for equity investments in property development companies, based on a report prepared by an independent appraiser: collecting the independent appraisers engagement letter and assessing his/her competency and independence with respect to the Company, collecting the independent appraisers report and critically assessing the valuation methods used, gaining an understanding of the main inputs used to implement the discounted cash flow and comparable multiples methods; verifying the amounts booked with respect to impairment; verifying the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements.", "In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also

evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion.", "The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements; assess the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.", "This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report.", "However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.", "If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion; evaluate the overall

performance, the sharing of best practices and investments in energy efficiency equipment.", "SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Act for the Planet Energy monitoring All centers use the Deepki tool to monitor and report monthly energy, water, and waste consumption data in a standardized method.", "This enables the Group to analyze data at the shopping center, country, regional and portfolio levels, control climate factors and undertake a robust benchmarking assessment according to opening hours and other variables.", "By establishing clusters of shopping centers that have similar variables such as retailer density, car park management, coverage of heating and cooling supply, surface area and construction and/or renovation dates, the Group has been able to identify the strongest and weakest performing assets in its portfolio and target energy management interventions accordingly.", "REDUCING ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION THROUGH NIGHT-TIME MONITORING A key focus for 2021 was monitoring and reducing the electricity use of all shopping centers during the night, to ensure all are operating to the best practice standard.", "As a first step, this entailed engaging shopping center management and technical teams to increase awareness on where and how they could monitor their electricity use.", "Second, local teams analyzed the consumption data to compare what the minimum electricity consumption should be versus what is currently being used.", "This required building an understanding of what needed to be running during the night such as CCTV in their individual shopping center, and then identifying what was driving the additional electricity consumption.", "Although the focus was on electricity, this ultimately led to consumption decreases across other energy types such as heating and cooling.", "Klpierre conducted monthly follow-ups for each center with webinars for the management and technical teams to review results, benchmark performance and share best practices amongst the teams.", "As a result, Klpierre developed nightly best practice operating standards which all centers can implement and be benchmarked against.", "At the end of 2021, Klpierres electricity consumption has decreased by 8% (reported scope), equivalent to 18,863MWh, mainly thanks tothis project.", "Inaddition, six centers were able to achieve a reduction in their electricity consumption of over 70%.", "Energy management and engagement Klpierres energy reduction strategy is supported by energy management software, which uses a range of meters to record the energy use of individual

improvement opportunities and medium-term energy efficiency interventions within their current means.", "BOOST results can also enrich ongoing discussions with retailers, providing them with feedback on what could be optimized to make savings on a store-wide scale.", "In 2021, Klpierre introduced a new dimension to the programme, addressing the energy efficiency of expansions and refurbishments from delivery.", "The BOOST process was applied to analyze the delivery of recent refurbishments and Klpierre worked with the construction and project management teams to identify performance improvements that could be made from the outset.", "As well as improving energy efficiency, the process increased collaboration and supported a smooth handover between the project management and operational teams, supported by a comprehensive handover checklist that minimizes any issues once the building is delivered.", "Moving forward, the in-house standards of testing and commissioning created because of the project will enable the Group to apply the learnings from this process to other development activities.", "SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Act for the Planet Investments To make the right investments, Klpierre ensures that a shopping center is as close as possible to its optimum performance.", "In addition, the Group aims to implement energy efficiency measures above and beyond BREEAM requirements by focusing on local conditions, for example, by making sure to build insulation and ventilation that reduces energy demand from heating and air-conditioning.", "Annually, the Group aims to implement 10% of its total yearly CAPEX investments which are linked to improving the sustainability performance of its assets.", "However, in 2020 and 2021, investments have been limited to regulatory and safety required investments due to the pandemic.", "The Group targets BREEAM Excellent as the minimum performance standard for expansions and renovations.", "This includes the evaluation of a range of energy-related management and operational impacts, from life-cycle assessments and construction practices, to energy monitoring, lighting, and technical equipment specification.", "At the end of 2021, 95% (reported scope) was generated by renewable sources.", "As the Group renegotiates electricity contracts, it is progressively switching over to green tariffs.", "At present, 10 of the 12 countries where Klpierre operates are procuring 100% renewable electricity for their common and serviced areas.", "Klpierre is also procuring green gas in its

costs.", "The majority of Klpierres assets are fitted with multi-compartment waste bins to promote waste awareness towards visitors.", "Shopping center retailers receive training on how to segregate waste correctly and are provided with appropriate facilities.", "By engaging with waste contractors to set key performance indicators, providing waste training and incentives for employees and retailers, 99 top performing centers across 11 of Klpierres countries of operation have achieved waste recovery rates of 99% and above.", "In 2021, the Oslo City shopping center introduced sensors on compactors to detect their level of fullness.", "A yellow light signifies the machine is 75% full, prompting the center to get in touch with the waste collection supplier.", "Not only does this initiative lower costs, but helps to reduce GHG emissions due to a reduction in waste transportation.", "Klpierre uses the Deepki reporting platform to enter each shopping centers waste data for monthly analysis.", "This allows the Group to monitor waste flows using specific performance indicators and identify the types of waste being processed, enabling the Group to set suitable targets for each asset.", "The Groups BOOST interventions also support waste management.", "The program brings together shopping center teams, suppliers, waste contractors and technical experts from Group or country level, to conduct a deep dive analysis of individual shopping center waste practices over a 24-hour period.", "The team then creates an action plan, including a range of low-cost measures such as introducing changes to the layout and design of waste stations and storage facilities, improved guidance for retailers and the introduction of new waste streams for waste contractors.", "BOOST interventions and actions plans are key to this.", "They offer the Group deeper insight into the challenges faced by retailers in meeting 100% diversion rates, such as the use of packaging or products which are not compatible with the center waste flows, that prevent the effective sorting of waste or cannot be recycled.", "To support this approach, meetings take place annually to communicate waste and sorting standards and share feedback with retailers staff.", "Other circular economy-driven initiatives include free takeaway boxes, introduced in Portugal food courts to limit food waste.", "In three months, 4,000 boxes were given away and approximately 235kg of food saved.", "In Turkey, at the Akmerkez center, food waste was collected from center restaurants and turned into compost for its roof garden.", "At Crteil Soleil in France, through a partnership with Cycle Up, the center aims to extend the useful life of materials and products that were deconstructed in the refurbishment process, including stairs, automatic doors, marble, and flowerpots.", "Klpierre also encourages visitors to participate in the circular economy.", "For example, in Denmark and The Netherlands specifically, clothes collections were promoted in centers in exchange for benefits such as discounts to use in shops that engaged with the initiative.", "Klpierres water consumption is not substantial when compared with other real estate assets and has therefore not been identified as having a material environmental impact.", "However, the Group recognizes the importance of monitoring this data and applies best practices as part of its wider efforts to reduce its consumption of natural resources.", "This reflects a 22% decrease compared to 2020.", "Klpierre uses the Deepki

of assessment has been applied by the group in relation to tenants solvency (receivables relating to insolvent or bankrupt tenants have been provisioned in full) but also to operating losses faced by tenants during store closure periods.", "We have considered these valuations to be a key audit matter for the consolidated financial statements due to: the materiality of rent abatements liable to be granted and of impairment for credit losses taken as a whole for the consolidated financial statements, and the level of judgment required by management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "OUR RESPONSE We obtained an understanding of the processes implemented and the controls in place regarding the assessment of abatements under negotiation and impairment of receivables.", "For accrued abatements: we tested management assumptions linked to the collection rates by tenant depending on closure periods and; we assessed those assumptions considering, where applicable, tenants eligibility

therein.", "Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair

as the results of our audit.", "We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.", "Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.", "Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.", "We have duly been provided with the company and consolidated financial statements as well as the management report of the Executive Board within three months after the end of the financial year.", "The Supervisory Board has also been kept regularly informed by the Executive Board about the operations and business of the Company and its group, and has carried out, for the purposes of its duties, the necessary audits and controls.", "The Supervisory Board was able to perform its duties after having examined the recommendations made by its

uncertainties, of which the Group is not currently aware, or does not consider material or specific, may also have an unfavorable impact on its business, financial situation and results.", "The material and specific risks to the Group are presented below, grouped into five categories: macro and exogenous risks, strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks, and compliance and reputation risks.", "These risks have been selected on the basis of their gross impact and probability before taking into account risk management and internal control mechanisms set in place by the Group.", "Such risks are presented in the table below according to their residual criticality estimated in terms of impact and probability.", "Residual criticality factors in all the measures taken by the Group to reduce their occurrence or impact as well as the internal and external factors that mitigate them.", "For each of these risks, while examining the Groups 2021 risk map, the Supervisory Board, based on a recommendation by the Audit Committee, reviewed the level of their impact if they materialize, the probability of their occurrence, and the risk management and control mechanisms associated with them.", "Compared to the 2020 Universal Registration Document, the update of the risk mapping in 2021 has led to changes in the presentation of principal risk factors, but, also for the following risks, in their categorization, naming and/or evaluation: Human capital risk has been reassessed due to greater difficulties in retaining talent/pressure on wages/scarcity of resources in the labor market.", "The risk mitigation action plan has been redesigned based on the 2021-2023 roadmap developed by the Group HR department; Property investment market and asset rotation risk has been redefined and reassessed considering the historically low transaction volume for shopping centers used by appraiser to benchmark the fair value of properties; Regulatory and compliance risk is the result of two risks in the same category that have been merged; and Suppliers, service providers, JV partners and co-owners is the new name of the former Stakeholders risk, with Customers (retailers) being kept as a separate risk.", "In every country in which the Group does business, the success of its operations is dependent on the key macroeconomic indicators that underpin thecommercial real estate markets: GDP growth, purchasing power, consumption, inflation, exchange rates, unemployment, urban growth, local demographic factors and geopolitical stability.", "Impacts A negative macroeconomic outlook especially its consequences on the labor market and purchasing power is likely to manifest itself in lower footfall and a fall in tenant sales in Klpierres malls.", "This could diminish Klpierres ability to increase rents at lease renewal date and may require Klpierre to grant temporary rent relief to alleviate occupancy costs.", "Variable income, based on retailer sales, would also be automatically reduced.", "Should deflationary pressures settle in for a several years, it could lead retailers to default their rental obligations and close some stores.", "Falling rental income and higher vacancy rates could penalize asset values and appeal on the investment market.", "In countries outside the eurozone where rents are denominated in euro, a change in the exchange rate could have a negative impact on operating and financial costs for the retailers making the passing rental conditions less sustainable leading potentially in the medium term to lower rent, more vacancy and lower asset value.", "A sudden or unexpected deterioration in the geopolitical environment of one or several of the countries in which Klpierre operates could have adverse consequences on the Groups activity, return on investments or value of the assets concerned.", "Risk mitigation measures The diversified nature of Klpierres portfolio, with more than 100 assets across numerous European countries and many thousands of tenants representing all retail sectors, mitigates risks associated with adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions in any one market.", "Rents paid by the top ten tenants represent only 13% of Klpierres revenue.", "The Groups main tenants represent the leading companies in their sector.", "All tenants are subject to a financial health review before signing lease contracts and must provide financial guarantees.", "The use of long-term leases with a high portion of minimum guaranteed rents provides a stable rental income, with only a minority of early exit clauses activated.", "Assets are based in thriving urban locations and can generally be accessed within 30 minutes by onemillion people, ensuring a satisfactory catchment area overall, including in times of a downturn in the consumer spending cycle.", "Asset performance is regularly monitored by asset managers and individual business plans are updated annually for all the malls.", "Asset disposals are executed regularly to streamline the portfolio, which also enables the Group to verify the accuracy of the valuations reported in its accounting books.", "Eventually, Klpierre regularly renews the merchandising mix of its shopping centers and adapts the offering to macroeconomic trends to meet customers expectations.", "For example, the Group ensures that the retail brands in its shopping centers are adapted to household income in each catchment area.", "RISK AND CONTROL Key risk factors New developments Since spring 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic has declined on the back of vaccination measures.", "However, the overall impact of the pandemic is not yet known and some consequences are longer lasting, such as the decrease in footfall at some malls located on transport hubs and touristic areas, which have not yet returned to its pre-crisis level.", "The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022 immediately threw commodity and financial markets into turmoil.", "The most striking development has been that energy costs have become a major concern for both retailers and consumers.", "While it is still too early to measure the full extent of the impact of the geopolitical crisis on the economy, it will undoubtedly severely hamper global growth and drive a sharp rise in inflation, bringing the risk of stagflation in its wake.", "The disruption in certain supply chains as a direct result of the conflict or of the sanctions adopted against Russia could also affect the ability of certain retailers to operate under satisfactory conditions.", "Klpierre does not have operations in any of the countries in the current conflict zone.", "The increase in the cost of energy and certain raw materials could adversely impact the Group.", "However, anumber of measures have already been taken to stem the effect of these higher costs, including: securing energy purchase volumes in France until the end of 2022; adjusting uncommitted development projects (for which contracts have not yet been signed) in order to: assess potential additional costs and adjust budgets accordingly, prioritize locally available materials in the specifications, modify if possible certain provisions in the design phase.", "Tension in energy and commodity markets could also affect the profitability of the Groups customers.", "If inflation is not sufficiently offset by wage increases or government support measures, there is also the possibility that consumers purchasing power will be eroded.", "Any such loss of purchasing power generally affects discretionary purchases such as vacations, culture and eating out, whereas the Groups shopping centers are mainly positioned to meet every day needs like food, clothing, cleaning and healthcare products and affordable restaurants.", "If this adverse situation were to deteriorate over a prolonged period, it could result in the Groups retailers defaulting on payments or even filing for bankruptcy.", "It should be noted that the leases signed by the Group include an annual indexation clause based on the regulations specific to each country, designed to enable rents billed to increase in line with inflation.", "This section was not included in the Management Report as approved by the Executive Board on February 15, 2022.", "Residual criticality D Year-on-year criticality change 230 Description Technology-driven changes in consumer habits have seen e-commerce take hold across the markets in which Klpierre operates, prompting many retailers to adjust their business models and close some of their brick-and-mortar portfolio.", "At the same time, consumers are becoming more environmentally and socially aware, which may ultimately affect how and how much they consume.", "The continued growth of online retail may have a negative impact on footfall and tenant sales, cause a disruption in some retail segments or render some stores unprofitable.", "This could impact demand for new retail space as brick-and-mortar retailers move their operations online.", "The growth in consumers environmental awareness and the reallocation of their available resources (time and money) could have an impact on the profitability of certain tenants and in time, on the relevance of their presence in shopping centers (especially in view of the growing trend to buy used rather than new goods).", "Consequently, increasing vacancy rates and downward pressure on rents would affect rental income and asset values.", "The portfolio comprises flagship retail destinations where large national and international retailers operate among their best and most profitable stores.", "To meet customers expectations, a growing number of retailers have developed an omnichannel strategy which can be defined as a leading and nurturing customer New developments engagement approach.", "As part of this strategy, retailers give customers access to their products, offers and support services on all available channels, platforms and devices.", "The customer can be shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by phone or in a brick-and-mortar store and the experience is meant to be equally seamless.", "Taking advantage of the new omnichannel environment means selecting retailers that are agile and fast enough to offer an enhanced, quality-driven online and offline customer experience.", "The Group also facilitates these trends by supporting retailers in transforming their store formats and enhancing their appeal.", "Klpierre also leverages digital technology to offer both new services to its retailers and shoppers and use data to monitor the changing needs of its customers and thereby better meet their expectations.", "The Group implements a series of initiatives aimed at giving customers more reasons to visit, or stay longer, in its malls: beyond constantly adapting the retail offering, these initiatives include creating entertaining concepts and events, enhancing the food offering, and enriching the customer journey.", "Particularly, in 2021, Klpierre launched its Value for Money initiative, aiming at providing consumers with attractive shopping deals, discounts and exclusive offers on a permanent basis, in order to help them cope with an increasingly challenging economic environment.", "A delivery service will also be available.", "Through Act for Good, its ambitious CSR strategy, Klpierre also aims to promote sustainable retail and increase the contribution of its malls to local economies and communities through spaces dedicated to local initiatives, job forums as well as charity events.", "More generally, Act for Good aims at fostering actions destined to positively impacting people, territories and our planet.", "With developments in the pandemic having permitted the easing of travel restrictions and security measures in most countries, todays challenge is to analyze and engage as a corporate citizen to better understand the new behaviors, needs and purchasing habits that have emerged over the past two years.", "Identifying some of these new behaviors has enabled the Group to put in place new solutions, such as the Value for Money initiative, the loyalty program, Act for Good and omnichannel service centers.", "Klpierre has also launched a Europe-wide loyalty program, to which 25 shopping centers had already signed by the end of 2021.", "Such program leverages new digital possibilities to offer consumers additional and pertinent benefits to enhance loyalty and position its shopping centers as the consumers shopping destination of choice.", "Lastly, Klpierre has developed a fully digital in-house tool to optimize the management of relations with retailers.", "This state-of-the-art solution will make it easier to communicate with the retail community and employees in the malls, helping them reduce time spent on routine tasks, and ultimately enhancing their ability to service consumers.", "Operational excellence Residual criticality D Year-on-year criticality change Description Klpierres success is intrinsically linked to that of the tenants in its shopping centers.", "They are confronted with transformation challenges in their industry, and most of the risks that concern them could have an impact on the Groups results.", "It is therefore essential to select shopping center tenants based on the appeal of their concepts and offerings, the overall consistency of the merchandise mix for a given shopping center and its financial solidity.", "The Groups human capital comprises its employees, their knowledge, personalities, values and expertise.", "Our human capital is a key performance driver that must be secured and upgraded against a backdrop of social and economic change.", "The main risk for Klpierre is the loss of knowledge and talent that could occur if the Group fails to offer its employees a first-class career path.", "Attracting, training and retaining talent is a high priority.", "The rents paid by Klpierres tenants represent nearly all of the Groups operating income.", "The inability of one of Klpierres major tenants to pay its rent could substantially impact Klpierres revenue.", "Some leases include a variable share of the rent indexed to the retailers sales: a decrease in retailer sales would therefore also reduce Klpierres earnings.", "The retailer mix in malls affects attractiveness for visitors, and therefore profitability.", "The loss of an anchor retailer in a given shopping center could have a knock-on effect and lead to the departure of other tenants, adversely impacting Klpierres revenue and by extension, the value of its assets.", "New developments Changes in the competitive retail landscape could result in an increasing concentration of retailers physical points of sale at locations considered strategic for their business models.", "Failing to adequately reposition Klpierres portfolio or realign its geographical footprint with that of its retailers could lead to higher vacancy rates at Klpierre malls and consequently, a decrease in the value of its assets.", "Risk mitigation measures Diversifying Klpierres portfolio serves to limit its exposure to a bankruptcy or the departure of a key customer.", "The top ten retailers only represent 13% of invoiced rents in terms of their contributions to rental income.", "Klpierres strategy of focusing its asset portfolio on thriving, fast-growing catchment areas is consistent with retailers drive to reposition their physical points of sale in prime locations.", "The health crisis has propelled the increase of customer online sales and has blurred the lines between physical and digital sales.", "The merger of these streams has pushed most tenants to adapt an omnichannel strategy where sourcing, distribution, marketing, sales and delivery are all interconnected.", "By working closely with leading national and international brands and continually upgrading the merchandizing mix, we are positioning our portfolio to cater to the needs of an omnichannel ecosystem.", "Klpierres international footprint covering over 100 assets in more than ten countries is also a gateway to new markets for expanding retailers.", "The average financial vacancy which has peaked in August2021 is now in a downward trend, showing significant customer demand for our portfolio.", "Some were forced to close off-and-on for part of the year following government-ordered measures.", "When stores reopened overall sales reached close to 2019 figures, but footfall continued to lag behind (see above, Consumption habits risk).", "The calculation of variable rents indexed to retailer sales was directly impacted by the downturn in business.", "Additionally, with a view to continue attracting the most performing retailers, Klpierre wishes to expand its services with the launch of a digital application aimed at better managing the relationship with store managers and their teams.", "The application to be proposed to Klpierres shopping centers is a top-of-the-line, proprietary development that will allow them to minimize the time spent on daily tasks, and ultimately better service the shoppers.", "Residual criticality D Year-on-year criticality change Description As publicly accessible buildings, Klpierres shopping centers are exposed to health, safety and security risks the occurrence of which may adversely affect the shopping centers image, business or performance (or Klpierres as a whole).", "Failure to comply with relevant health and safety legislation or to protect people and assets against external safety and security threats could result in legal action or penalties for non-compliance.", "Shopping centers may also be subjected to temporary closure following a major health, safety or security incident, leading to a loss of business.", "Visitors and retailer employees may no longer feel safe within the shopping center and the surrounding area, leading to an adverse impact on the centers image and therefore on footfall and retailer sales, and on the Groups ability to retain or attract its customers.", "Risk mitigation measures Klpierres mitigation strategy focuses on the four following intervention points: Prevention The Group implemented preventive actions in accordance with its operating procedures covering significant health, New developments safety and security risks.", "These include measures such as building structure audits, seismic surveys in the areas concerned, hot work permits, air and water quality analyses as well as preventive installations such as security railings, fire/intrusion/gas alarms, anti-ram-car protection, etc.", "Shopping centers also provide the local police and fire service with round-the-clock access to all relevant support documents in the event of on-site emergency intervention.", "Training Shopping center directors and technical managers are trained or reskilled through face-to-face sessions managed by the Groups security & safety department or remotely through the Klpierre Universitys Learn Up!", "These training sessions focus on crisis management, standard operating procedures, site security and safety quick-assessment tools and preparation of large-scale counter-terrorist exercises in the shopping centers.", "Control tools and audits The Group has reviewed and updated its crisis management procedures and deployed incident reporting and monitoring software.", "Visible safety and security is provided by dedicated teams and guards permanently on site and working under the control of shopping center management teams.", "Compliance with health

epidemic hit continental Europe in late February2020, the Group set up a crisis management team supported by external experts, with a view to mitigating the impact of the crisis on consumers and retailers in its shopping centers, as well as on employees of the Group and its tenants.", "The team coordinated Klpierres response to the crisis in each affected area, ensuring that its operations were compliant with the measures enacted by the authorities on a real-time basis.", "The Group continuously reviewed its operating organization and resources so as to ensure the best possible health and safety conditions while maintaining business continuity.", "As recommended by health bodies and governments, it also adapted its working environment to the mass switch to home working by swiftly providing all employees with appropriate IT equipment and tools.", "The impact of the spread of the virus on the footfall of the shopping centers led to an automatic decrease in the numberof safety and security incidents in 2020 and 2021.", "If the health crisis were to continue over the long term, this could cause social unrest as seen with the Yellow vests protests in certain French towns and cities in 2019.", "Appropriate measures should then be taken.", "This public order risk has been anticipated since 2017, through the gradual deployment of a holistic approach to safety and security and more stringent safety and security procedures, making it possible to mitigate these risks more effectively.", "The people employed by the Group have abilities, personalities, values, working methods, knowledge, expertise and skills that make up the Groups human capital.", "The development of this capital is essential for securing, renewing and constantly enriching the Groups expertise, which is a driver of its overall performance.", "In a rapidly evolving industry and amid ever-changing societal trends, the main risk is the loss of key people.", "This risk could arise if the Group fails to deliver a first-class employee experience.", "As the job market becomes increasingly tight, attracting, training and retaining talent is a top priority.", "Impact A loss of key skills, knowledge and expertise due to uncontrolled staff attrition, or a lack of engagement on the part of employees, could: (i) impact the Groups ability to carry on its businesses, (ii) be costly in terms of the need to recruit and train new employees, and (iii) damage Klpierres reputation in the event of negative employee experiences.", "This could lead to a decline in the Groups appeal as an employer and would reduce its ability to attract, retain and develop talented employees, especially in key positions.", "New developments Risk mitigation measures To ensure that Group has the best trained and most effective teams, both today and in the future, the HR teams have implemented a strategy based on four pillars aimed at continuously improving the employee experience within the Group: Embracing change and supporting business transformations by anticipating the social impacts of new developments, tools and strategies and by equipping project leaders and managers with solid skills in project management, change management and emotional intelligence; Attracting, training and inspiring the best talent, with an emphasis on leadership and management; Motivating the teams, paying particular attention to social dialog and the organization of internal events, as well as to attractive compensation and benefits; and Building a pleasant work environment, that is both diverse and inclusive, focused on health and work-life balance, but also by a more independent approach to human resources management through the implementation of a new Human Resources Management Information System (HRMS).", "In 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to impact the Groups employees, who demonstrated flexibility in their work, adapting to health measures where necessary.", "Most of the teams worked from home during the year and the Group maintained the initiatives implemented in 2020: technological investments to facilitate remote working, increased individual mentoring, enhanced management training around new management skills, and the launch of a digital events program to maintain ties despite social distancing.", "Based on an employee appraisal process and with a view to constantly improving its business, the Group has accelerated internal mobility in its countries and at its headquarters, and particularly international mobility for its executive teams.", "Mobility play an important role in talent retention.", "Engage, Explore, Develop and Care-a prelude to overhauling our management and leadership programs and to redefining our behavioral competency model.", "By putting words to its culture and what brings people together, and by communicating its values and leadership development, the Group will significantly increase its teams commitment.", "Klpierre University continued to offer hybrid development programs and provided online training where necessary.", "The network of in-house trainers, which is still very active, has been working to train teams

ambassadors has also been set up, comprising 40 people responsible for piloting initiatives at the local country level.", "The network designed and organized an initial Diversity & Inclusion Week in December 2021, with the aim of raising awareness and changing mindsets about inclusion in the broadest sense, but also about gender equality, generational diversity, disability integration and prejudice, among others.", "Co-owners: in some specific situations where the vote of a qualified majority of co-owners is required, diverging strategic interests with the different co-owners could limit Klpierres ability to deploy its redevelopment plan for a given asset or limit its capacity to maintain the assets appeal to customers or require Klpierre to support the whole costs of a major

providers: the bulk of goods and services procured by the Group is made up of utilities (energy and water), cleaning, maintenance, marketing and safety and security.", "Co-owners and joint venture partners: some of the Groups assets are part of larger real estate complexes, part of which are owned by third parties or are jointly owned with them by Klpierre.", "These multi-owner structures require alignment of interest to allow Klpierre to deploy its shopping center operational and development strategy.", "Impact Suppliers and service providers: poor performance of a service or even failure to perform the service in the event of bankruptcy could have an operational impact on Klpierre, potentially impact the attractiveness of its shopping malls and impair its BtoB reputation.", "Likewise, any instances of non-compliance with internationally accepted human rights through its supply chain could lead to reputational damage for the Group.", "In addition, excessive dependence of a given service provider on Klpierre may lead to legal and financial consequences such as the requalification of service agreements in employment contracts.", "New developments Since the start of the health crisis, the Group focused on securing the business continuity of its suppliers and service providers, which are contractually committed to maintaining a required level of service.", "This has been particularly important in the case of security guards and cleaning staff.", "Operational excellence Residual criticality D Year-on-year criticality change Description Klpierres development activity is focused on enhan-cing its own properties through refurbishments and extensions and may also include the development of greenfield projects.", "In most European countries, commercial urban planning projects take many years and present significant risks in terms of obtaining the necessary administrative, building and lease authorizations.", "Typical risks include delays in securing the building permits, in the execution of work, and in signing lease agreements.", "They also include construction cost overruns or shortfalls in meeting rental targets.", "The main potential impacts are: The abandonment of the project in the design phase and the loss of expenses already incurred; The sale of the land plot at a price potentially below its original value; and A lower return on investment after completion of construction works.", "In all cases these may result in adverse consequences on Klpierres financial results, growth strategy and market reputation.", "Risk mitigation measures Before being committed, development projects must successively be examined by the Development Committee, the Executive Board, the Investment Committee, and the Supervisory Board.", "The validation criteria include: Consistency of the project with the Groups capital allocation strategy and financial capacity, operational targets, and CSR policy; Technical feasibility and local acceptability; Satisfactory pre-leasing rate; and A return on investment in line with the projects risk profile and expected return on Klpierres capital.", "Progress on development projects is examined regularly by the Executive Board.", "To limit potential loss of upfront costs and the risk of not obtaining regulatory clearance, development teams engage with stakeholders to ensure they support the proposed project as soon as a feasibility study has been carried out.", "Detailed design costs are not incurred without having run a preliminary financial analysis confirming the viability of the project.", "Construction is not started before a high level of leasing is secured with retailers and specifically with anchors and junior anchors.", "New developments The commitments undertaken by the Group in terms of real estate development are few and far between at the present time, due namely to the health crisis but also to retailers reluctance to commit to new projects at a time when growth in e-commerce is prompting them to consider the pertinence of their store portfolios.", "The health crisis led to the temporary suspension of committed construction projects in order to limit cash outflows and gain more visibility.", "The projects are now back on track and in line with the updated planning.", "Risk mitigation measures Klpierre regularly stress tests its balance structure to anticipate the effects of a potential asset valuation decline.", "In Europe, investor demand varies from country to country and so do market dynamics and the pace of the asset valuation movements.", "Klpierre ensures a geographically balanced portfolio to benefit from the averaging effects of a diversified exposure.", "Klpierre applies a disciplined capital expenditure policy with a low volume of committed development projects always in line with its operating free cash flow.", "Consequently, Klpierre does not depend on asset disposals to ensure the stability of its leverage level while investing in property extensions or refurbishment.", "All proposals to acquire, develop or sell assets are subject to extensive audits.", "Klpierre also hires the services of specialized and highly reputed advisers (including lawyers, notaries, bankers, real estate experts and auditors) to support buy-and sell-side due diligence processes.", "Transactions and investments are successively challenged by the Executive Board, the Investment Committee and the Supervisory Board.", "By contracting leading independent appraisal firms to value its portfolio assets twice a year, the Group can promptly detect emerging trends in the market.", "The findings of this external process are cross-checked with the analyses conducted by the Groups asset managers, helping to facilitate reallocation decisions.", "Description Klpierre is invested in retail commercial property and fluctuations in investor demand linked to the perceived resilience of the rental income, the availability of financing, the relative attractiveness of the asset class compared to other types of commercial properties and the level of risk-free interest rates, may result in asset valuation decreases or increases.", "Portfolio rotation is an inherent part of Klpierres strategy as a property investor.", "The Groups aim is to optimize the performance of its portfolio by constantly ensuring its shopping centers are positioned in the most profitable and dynamic catchment areas.", "Buying or selling an asset may give rise to risks related to a faulty assessment of the intrinsic quality or potential of the asset.", "This would then result in an inaccurate assessment of assets actual value.", "Considering the cyclical nature of the property investment market, the timing of transactions may also be unfavorable.", "Impacts Subdued investor demand may have an impact on the valuation of shopping centers and therefore affect the balance sheet structure of the Company, increasing its loan-to-value level which may have consequences on the Companys ability to refinance itself, raise equity or distribute dividends in optimal conditions.", "Additionally, inadequate acquisition or divestment decisions could have an adverse impact on the Groups financial position, operating results and growth prospects.", "These may result in the loss of opportunities, a deterioration in the Groups performance or impairment losses.", "This could in turn result in disputes with buyers or sellers and a loss of investor confidence.", "Failure to pursue the portfolio optimization strategy could harm the Groups long-term performance and hence its market capitalization.", "Residual criticality D Year-on-year criticality change Description Climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in the numberof extreme weather-related events.", "With assets spanning Europe, shopping centers are likely to be affected by weather phenomena including storms, snow, floods, droughts, heat waves and forest fires.", "Climate change could also lead to growing political pressure, including more stringent regulation.", "Impacts Extreme weather-related events could impact Klpierres business continuity and result in the temporary or permanent closure of assets.", "Climatic changes are also likely to result in an increase in costs for the development, construction and operation of assets.", "For example, additional costs are likely to be incurred in upgrading equipment, design and construction standards to deal with higher temperatures.", "Supplementary expenses could also be spent to repair damages caused to the building after severe weather-related events.", "Operating costs could also increase for heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment designed to maintain pleasant ambient temperatures.", "Other potential costs include an increase in insurance premiums, as insurers prices are at risk of increasing in extreme weather-related events.", "RISK AND CONTROL Key risk factors Risk mitigation measures The Groups diversified geographic footprint mitigates the exposure to extreme weather-related events and major environmental risks are factored into acquisition and disposal decisions.", "With regards to its standing assets, the Group has developed internal measures including energy management tools, audits, and other procedures to reduce energy consumption and improve environmental efficiency.", "In addition, all Klpierre assets undergo an audit every five years to check their structural condition.", "Klpierre has an ambitious environmental performance program designed to reduce natural resource consumption and improve supply quality by: Improving operational energy efficiency and reducing heating or air conditioning needs, thereby managing potential temperature variations without excess consumption; Reducing carbon emissions; and Limiting the use of potable water.", "The Group has also rolled out initiatives to limit its dependence on fossil fuel-based natural resources by increasing the use of on-site renewables, purchasing green energy and promoting soft mobility.", "With a view to constantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Klpierre implemented BOOST action plans (on-site workshops lasting two consecutive days aimed at identifying all the drivers for reducing energy consumption) within a large portion of its portfolio.", "Similar initiatives were launched to increase the rate of recycling and proportion of waste recovered with an objective of recovering 100% of waste produced in the assets by 2022.", "New developments None of Klpierres shopping centers in 2021 were subject to extreme weather conditions that significantly disturbed operations.", "Should such events occur, the Group has action plans for limiting the operational impact and property damage.", "In addition, in 2021, 95% of the electricity used in the common and serviced areas of Klpierres centers was drawn from renewable energy.", "Moreover, since 2019 three years ahead of schedule the Group has been the largest real estate portfolio in the world by value to be BREEAM In-Use certified for sustainable asset performance across its entire portfolio.", "A list compiled by CDP, an NGO specialized in corporate environmental disclosure.", "CDP scores companies from A to D based on the comprehensiveness of their disclosure, their management of environmental risks and their ability to set ambitious and meaningful targets.", "More than 13,000 companies worldwide were evaluated by CDP this year on environmental performance.", "Only 16 of these companies were included in the A list for the real estate sector, five of them in Europe.", "This dual distinction shows the relevance of the Act for Good CSR policy for effectively combating global warming at the level of Klpierres European portfolio.", "Description Since property investment is a capital-intensive business, Klpierre needs to raise long-term financial resources in the form of bonds, loans or equity to fund its investments and regularly refinance maturing debts.", "This exposes the Group to risks related to equity and debt capital markets fluctuations, liquidity crises and broader economic shocks.", "Impacts Any limitations of access to debt financing, restrictions of credit conditions, a liquidity crisis or broader economic downturn may have a significant impact on Klpierres ability to refinance its debts when they are due for repayment.", "Such event would potentially make Klpierre unable to remain operational as a going concern, or increase funding costs resulting in an adverse impact on the Groups earnings.", "Furthermore, in addition to the usual covenants, the loan agreements entered into by Klpierre also contain covenants obliging the Group to comply with specific financial ratios.", "If Klpierre were to breach one of its covenants and were unable to remedy that failure within the time contractually allowed, the lenders could demand early repayment of the loan, which could affect all of the Groups debt if cross-default clauses were exercised.", "The forced sale of assets to remedy covenant breach may also impact the Groups earnings and its asset values.", "Risk mitigation measures Klpierre follows a prudent financial policy and aims to secure a high credit rating of at least investment grade.", "This is currently the case, with the Group rated BBB+ with a stable outlook by S&P.", "The Group also applies a prudent interest rate risk management policy.", "The Groups target hedging rate is approximately 70%.", "This rate is defined as the proportion of fixed-rate debt (after hedging) to gross borrowings.", "As of December31, 2021, taking into account only fixed-rate debt and debt hedged at a fixed rate, the hedging rate was 77%.", "Factoring in options (caps), the rate was 91%.", "This means that the Company can refinance immediately if it has difficulty renewing its borrowings on the commercial paper market.", "New developments In the specific context of the health crisis, which impacted Klpierres ability to collect rents, the Group managed to contain the increase in debt, in particular through the immediate reduction in its capex program.", "The Group has the necessary flexibility to continue funding its business activities, while ensuring a satisfactory level of investment without being dependent on possible disposals.", "The monetary support measures put in place since 2020 by the European Central Bank made it easier for the Group to tap into the capital markets.", "Klpierre also benefits from the French SIIC tax regime, or equivalent in other countries.", "Changes in these laws and regulations or the intro-duction of new legal and regulatory provisions or the non-compliance of Klpierres entities or their activities with them, as well as the non-compliance with contractual commitments or procedures put in place, could have an impact on Klpierre and its activities.", "Impacts A tightening of urban planning regulations, which would limit the availability of rental space, could have an impact on the development potential of shopping centers and, consequently, slow down the implementation of the Groups pipeline.", "Conversely, a relaxation of these same rules may increase competition and lead to a decline in footfall, rental income and potentially an increase in vacancy rates.", "A tightening of requirements in terms of maintenance, control or security measures in shopping centers could have a significant impact on the costs of associated service providers.", "Any change in the tax regime that would result in an increase in the tax rate could have a negative impact on the Klpierre Group and its results, resulting in a decrease in its earnings.", "Failure to identify or comply with applicable legal and regulatory provisions could result in criminal or pecuniary condemnation, or even deterioration of the Groups New developments image.", "In addition, non-compliance in a shopping center could result in a temporary or permanent interruption of activity in the center.", "Finally, non-compliance with contractual clauses could in certain cases lead to the termination of said contract and the associated benefits or the implementation of the liability of the Klpierre Group entity concerned.", "Risk mitigation measures The Groups Legal Department, with the support of the local legal departments, regularly monitors the compliance and regulatory environment in the countries where the Group operates.", "The same approach is adopted for monitoring of disputes and litigation.", "The Groups Risk Management Department, in cooperation with the Groups Legal Department, establishes procedures at Group level which are deployed in the countries where Klpierre operates in order to ensure compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions then applicable.", "At shopping center level, certain technical service providers are contractually obliged to monitor local regulations, which limits the risk of non-compliance due to unanticipated regulatory changes.", "In addition, a digital platform has been set up to help monitor the compliance of shopping centers and to create a common reference system for the security of shopping centers owned by the Klpierre.", "Thanks to its Internal Audit Department and the use of external audits (over and above the Statutory Auditors report), as well as the continuous improvement of its processes, the Group ensures the constant alignment between operational practices and strategic objectives.", "In any case, the matrix organization of the Klpierre Group allows, via two levels of control (local level and Group level), the proper application of Group procedures.", "The Group also actively contributes to the work of national or international bodies representing the commercial real estate sector in particular, but also to broader professional bodies.", "The health crisis has two major influences.", "The first is the tightening of standards and controls, which increase the operating costs of shopping centers while limiting their patronage.", "The second is the intervention of most European legislators in the contractual relation between landlords and lessee to adapt, if necessary, some of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties during the Covid-19 crisis, and specifically during administrative closures of the stores.", "To ensure that it has fully understood the expectations of legislators and administrative authorities, Klpierre has enlisted the services of renowned external consultants and auditors who have visited all the shopping centers in the portfolio to certify their compliance with the health recommendations of each country.", "Klpierre also actively monitors regulatory developments and any resulting interpretations or court decisions.", "The increasing complexity and stringency of the legislative and regulatory environment in which Klpierre operates increases the risk of regulatory non-compliance.", "However, this risk must be qualified in view of the creation of a dedicated unit within the Groups Legal Department in charge of legal compliance.", "Internal control and compliance frameworks are implemented by operational management and employees to provide reasonable assurance to senior management and shareholders that the following objectives are met: Compliance with applicable legislation, external regulations and Klpierres internal rules; Implementation of instructions and guidelines provided by the executive
