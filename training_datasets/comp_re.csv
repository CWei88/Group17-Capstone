The NRCs duties and responsibilities in relation to remuneration matters are set out on page 184 of this Annual Report.
"REMUNERATION MATTERS Principles 6, 7 and 8: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies, Level and Mix of Remuneration and Disclosure on Remuneration All fees and remuneration payable to Directors, key management personnel (including the CEO) and staff of the Manager are paid by the Manager."
"The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on Director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and key management personnel."
It has established the NRC to review the Board remuneration framework and determine the specific remuneration for the Directors.
The NRC also reviews the compensation framework and remuneration for the CICT Groups executives and approves the specific remuneration packages for the key management personnel.
The remuneration framework and policy are designed to support the implementation of the CICT Groups business strategy and deliver sustainable returns to Unitholders.
"Corporate Governance Fair & Appropriate Ensure competitive remuneration relative to the appropriate external talent markets Manage internal equity such that remuneration is viewed as fair across the CICT Group Significant and appropriate portion of pay-at-risk, taking into account risk policies of the CICT Group, symmetrical with risk outcomes and sensitive to the risk time horizon Effective Implementation Maintain rigorous corporate governance standards Exercise appropriate flexibility to meet strategic business needs and practical implementation considerations Facilitate employee understanding to maximise the value of the remuneration programme These remuneration policies are in line with the CICT Groups business strategy and the executive compensation framework is based on the key principle of linking pay to performance, which is emphasised by linking total remuneration to the achievement of corporate and individual goals and objectives."
"The NRC considers all aspects of remuneration, including termination terms, to ensure they are fair, and has access to remuneration consultants for advice on remuneration matters as required."
"In reviewing policies on remuneration and determining the remuneration packages for key management personnel, the NRC, through an independent remuneration consultant, takes into consideration appropriate compensation benchmarks within the industry, so as to ensure that the remuneration packages payable to key management personnel are competitive and in line with the objectives of the remuneration policies."
It also considers the compensation framework of CLI as a point of reference.
"In FY 2021, Willis Towers Watson was appointed as independent remuneration consultant to provide professional advice on executive remuneration."
"Remuneration of Key Management Personnel Remuneration of key management personnel comprises fixed components, a variable cash component, Unit-based components and employee benefits."
"A significant proportion of key management personnels remuneration is in the form of variable compensation, awarded in a combination of short-term and long-term incentives, in keeping with the principle that the interests of the key management personnel should be aligned with those of Unitholders and that the remuneration framework should link rewards to business and individual performance."
The Manager believes that the Unit-based components of the remuneration for key management personnel serve to align the interests of such key management personnel with that of Unitholders and CICTs long-term growth and value.
"Coupled with interlocking annual grants, this ensures ongoing alignment between remuneration and sustainable business performance in the longer term."
"Each year, the NRC evaluates the extent to which each of the key management personnel has delivered on the business and individual goals and objectives, and based on the outcome of the evaluation, approves the compensation for the key management personnel."
"In such evaluation, the NRC considers whether the level of remuneration is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate key management personnel to successfully manage CICT for the long term."
The CEO does not attend discussions relating to his own performance and remuneration.
"Corporate Governance Unitholders due to the intense competition for talents in the industry, as well as the need to balance the confidential and commercial sensitivities associated with remuneration matters."
"The Manager is making available, however, the CEOs remuneration amount in a band of S$250,000 and the aggregate of the total remuneration of the other key management personnel (excluding the CEO) together with a breakdown of their respective remuneration components in percentage terms, which are set out in the Key Management Personnels Remuneration Table on page 203 of this Annual Report."
"The Manager is of the view that its practice of disclosing the aforementioned information and the other disclosures on this Report is consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the Code and provides sufficient information and transparency to the Unitholders on the Managers remuneration policies and the level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration and the relationship between remuneration, performance and value creation."
"In addition, the remuneration of the key management personnel is not borne by CICT as it is paid out of the fees that the Manager receives (the quantum and basis of which have been disclosed)."
"In this regard, the remuneration of such Outsourced Personnel, being employees of the CLI Subsidiary and CLI Group, is not included as part of the disclosure of remuneration of key management personnel of the Manager in this Report."
"The Board, together with the NRC, seeks to ensure that the remuneration of the CEO and other key management personnel is strongly linked to the achievement of business and individual performance targets."
"In addition, such compensation is in the long-term interests of CICT as CICT is a key part of CLIs business and ecosystem (and it is also the largest Unitholder of CICT), and Managements actions to grow CICT and drive CICTs performance will also have a positive impact on CLI, thus reinforcing the complementary nature of the linked performance between CICT and CLI."
The cost of this one-time award will be borne by the Manager and it will not form a significant part of the key management personnels annual remuneration.
"In addition, as can be seen in the Key Management Personnels Remuneration Table for FY 2021, a proportion of the Managements remuneration is paid in the form of Units, which further incentivises the Management to take actions which are beneficial to the Unitholders."
"Accordingly, the Special PSP Award will not result in the Management prioritising the interest of CLI over that of CICT given that the bulk of their remuneration is determined based on the evaluation of the performance of CICT and a proportion of their remuneration comprises Units."
The Manager is required under the AIFMR to make quantitative disclosures of remuneration.
All individuals included in the aggregated figures disclosed are rewarded in line with the Managers remuneration policies described in this Report.
There was a total of 23 beneficiaries of the remuneration described above.
"Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors The non-executive Directors fees are paid by the Manager and the FY 2021 fees, together with a breakdown of the components, are set out in the Non-Executive Directors Remuneration Table on page 203 of this Annual Report."
The compensation policy for non-executive Directors is based on a scale of fees divided into basic retainer fees for serving as Director and additional fees for attendance and serving on Board Committees.
"The remuneration of non-executive Directors is reviewed from time to time to ensure that it is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate the non-executive Directors to provide good stewardship of the Manager and CICT."
No individual Director is involved in any decision of the NRC relating to his or her own remuneration.
"As with previous years, an independent remuneration consultant, Willis Towers Watson, was engaged in FY 2021 to provide professional advice on Board remuneration, with a view to ensuring the fee structure remains in line with market."

"As such, quantitative criteria are not strictly predominant in determining the annual variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer."

This status is reviewed annually by the Nomination and Compensation Committee by means of individual independence questionnaires submitted to Supervisory Board members (see table below in respect of 2021).
"The Nomination and Compensation Committees recommendations are then communicated to the Supervisory Board, which subsequently reviews the situation of each member of the Supervisory Board."
"First, the Nomination and Compensation Committee and then the Supervisory Board review the various relationships in question to ascertain whether or not they constitute business relationships."
"Selection of new Supervisory Board members In the event of a vacancy of one or more independent members, the Nomination and Compensation Committee is responsible for proposing new members to the Supervisory Board, after having assiduously reviewed all factors required to achieve a balanced Board membership."
"To this end, the Nomination and Compensation Committee organizes a procedure aimed at selecting the future independent members and commissions any research that it considers relevant in this undertaking."
No compensation is paid or due under offices held at Group subsidiaries.
"Compensation levels enable us to attract and retain the best talent The appropriate level of compensation, both fixed and variable, is essential to attract, retain and motivate the best talent."
The compensation offered should therefore be competitive and in line with market practices for comparable companies.
"In compliance with the principle of comparability recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Nomination and Compensation Committee regularly reviews its approach using studies conducted by various independent specialists based on panels of companies of a similar size and/or operating in the same business sector as Klpierre, and with comparable international exposure."
Compensation packages are balanced and take into account areas of responsibility Compensation paid to Supervisory Board members includes a fixed amount and a predominantly variable amount based on actual attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and/or Committees on which they sit.
"Regarding Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board ensures that compensation is balanced (fixed, short-term variable and long-term variable components), with each component representing about one-third of total compensation for the year."
"Compensation of executive corporate officers is performance-based The recognition of the performance of executive corporate officers strikes a balance between their interests, those of Klpierre and those of its shareholders."
"Accordingly, the compensation package for Executive Board members is subject to performance conditions, concerning both the short-term variable portion and the allotment of performance shares."
"These criteria are regularly updated by the Nomination and Compensation Committee, as well as by the Supervisory Board."
Compensation of executive corporate officers takes into account the compensation and employment conditions applicable to Klpierre employees Pertinent information on the Groups compensation policy is regularly provided to the Nomination and Compensation Committee.
"In addition, the Supervisory Board also includes criteria related to employment conditions for the Groups employees in the objectives underpinning the variable compensation payable to Executive Board members."
"For example, the short-term variable compensation objectives assessed include initiatives promoting diversity and talent development."
Compensation of executive corporate officers reflects Klpierres CSR objectives to promote long-term growth Both short-and long-term variable components are subject to non-financial criteria regarding CSR issues.
"Based on the Nomination and Compensation Committees work, the Supervisory Board then sets the compensation policy to be put to the vote at Klpierres next General Meeting."
"The same process applies if the compensation policy is revised, or if exceptions are made."
"At the beginning of each year, acting on the recommendation of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the Supervisory Board allots the previous years compensation among its members, taking into account the offices held by each member on the Board and its various Committees and their attendance record."
The table below presents the steps and timeline for setting the compensation of the Chairman and the Executive Board members.
"POST-GENERAL MEETING OF PRIOR YEAR AND FIRST QUARTER OF CURRENT YEAR Nomination and Compensation Committee The Nomination and Compensation Committee analyzes any changes in corporate governance and, in particular, reviews reports on the meetings organized as part of the annual governance roadshows."
FROM FEBRUARY/MARCH OF CURRENT YEAR Supervisory Board On the basis of the Nomination and Compensation Committees work and recommendations: The Supervisory Board sets the current years compensation policy; The amount of short-term variable compensation payable to the Chairman and members of the Executive Board in respect of the prior year is set by the Supervisory Board based on its assessment of their performance with regard to the quantitative and qualitative criteria.
"The qualitative criteria are assessed on the basis of the Nomination and Compensation Committees report; As regards long-term incentive plans that have matured, the Board takes due note of the performance levels achieved with regard to the applicable performance conditions."
The compensation policy for the current year is submitted to the vote of the General Meeting (ex ante say on pay); The compensation and benefits paid during or allotted for the previous year (i) to all corporate officers as a whole and (ii) to each executive corporate officer are also submitted to the vote (ex-post say on pay).
"SUPERVISORY BOARD S REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of corporate officers The Nomination and Compensation Committee and the Supervisory Board rely in particular on the following resources when setting the compensation policy: possibility to hire highly reputed independent specialized consultants, in particular for benchmarking; meetings with the Groups General Secretary, who supervises the Legal and Human Resources Group Departments, for example to obtain information about the compensation and employment terms of the Groups employees; meetings with investors and proxy advisors."
No changes are envisaged in the compensation policy of the Chairman and the other members of the Supervisory Board for 2022 versus the policy in place for fiscal year 2021.
"No other components of compensation are awarded to the Chairman and members of the Supervisory Board or its Committees, and no agreements (employment or service agreements) have been entered into by Board or Committee members with the Company (or within the Group)."
"The compensation policy for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board has remained unchanged throughout their three-year term of office, which ends in June 2022."
"The Nomination and Compensation Committee regularly benchmarks the practices of companies comparable in size and activities to Klpierre, notably to verify (i) the appropriateness of Executive Board member compensation with regard to the Groups size and to Board members experience as well as (ii) the competitiveness of the compensation offered to Executive Board members versus the benchmark."
"In view of the results of the study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee in January/February 2022 (detailed below) and the recent departure of a member of the Executive Board to manage another company in the industry, the Nomination and Compensation Committee felt it was appropriate to recommend to the Supervisory Board that it establish the components of compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board that would represent the compensation policy applicable for fiscal year 2022, taking into account certain changes in relation to the policy applicable for fiscal year 2021 which were approved by the Supervisory Board: Maintain the current compensation structure based on three components: Fixed compensation, determined on the basis of the responsibilities of the Chairman and of the other members of the Executive Board, which must be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain the best talent, Short-term variable compensation, the aim of which is to associate the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board with the Groups short-term performance, and Long-term incentives, to align the interests of the beneficiaries as closely as possible with the interests of shareholders, with a view to creating long-term value; Maintain (practically unchanged) the maximum total compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board."
"Positioning of Executive Board member compensation in light of reference panels To ensure a consistent approach, the benchmark study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee to verify the market positioning of the compensation of the Executive Board members was based on the same two panels as those used during the previous changes in the compensation policy that took place in 2019: a panel of 40 SBF 120 companies centered around Klpierres last The charts below show that the 2022 compensation levels for executive corporate officers as submitted to the vote of the General Meeting are consistent with Klpierres positioning (in terms of its market capitalization) within the reference panels selected."
"Quantitative criteria, up to 80% of fixed compensation + Qualitative criteria, up to 50% of fixed compensation Absolute stock market performance of Klpierre (TSR) Relative stock market performance versus a panel of comparable companies (TSR) Internal performance (change in shopping center net rental income) CSR performance 10% 30% 40% 20% Performance assessed over three years, followed by a two-year lock-up period Shareholding obligation (a) Short-term compensation is equal to the sum of fixed compensation and short-term variable compensation when the target is fully met."
"The following table summarizes the structure of the compensation of the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board under the 2022 compensation policy as submitted to the vote of the General Meeting, and the changes compared to 2021: Compensation Fixed compensation Short-term variable compensation Long-term variable compensation Comments After remaining unchanged from 2019 to 2022, the fixed compensation of the members of the Executive Board would be increased as from their re-appointment (June 22, 2022) to take account of market trends: The fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Executive Board would be increased from 750,000 to 825,000; The fixed compensation of the other members of the Executive Board (Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer) would be increased from 480,000 and 450,000, respectively, to 500,000."
"In respect of 2021: variable compensation is determined using (i) a quantitative objective of net cash flow per share, one of the key indicators used by the Group in its communications with the markets, and (ii) a qualitative component based on specific objectives set for each Executive Board member."
"The quantitative portion can represent up to 80% of fixed compensation, and the qualitative portion up to 50%."
"In respect of 2022: variable compensation would be determined using (i) a quantitative objective based on net cash flow per share, and (ii) a qualitative component based on specific objectives set for each Executive Board member."
"The quantitative portion would be raised to 100% of fixed compensation, and the qualitative portion held at 50%."
In respect of 2021: the value of long-term variable compensation is 125% of short-term compensation(b).
In respect of 2022: the value of long-term variable compensation is reduced to 100% of short-term compensation.
"In exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board, having solicited the opinion of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, may exercise its judgment to adapt and/or amend the performance criteria and/or the calculation scale (upwards or downwards) used to determine the short-term variable compensation of the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board in the event that the impact of such circumstances were disproportionate with regard to the fundamental principles of the compensation policy."
"Exceptional circumstances that may give rise to the use of this faculty include any exogenous event that could not reasonably have been taken into consideration or quantified at the time the compensation policy was set, such as the Covid-19 health crisis and subsequent developments, and any events with a comparable impact on Klpierres business."
"Should a new Chairman of the Executive Board be appointed, the principles and criteria provided for in the last compensation policy approved by the General Meeting would also apply to that person."
"In such cases, acting on the recommendation of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the Supervisory Board will, in light of existing practices and based on the situation of the executive concerned, determine the different components of compensation, which shall a) Fixed annual compensation for fiscal year 2022 not exceed those set out in said policy."
"To summarize, Jean-Marc Jestins compensation is typically split into equal portions between the fixed component (including benefits in kind), the short-term variable component and the long-term variable component."
"The Chairman of the Executive Boards compensation includes the following components: The fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Executive Board for fiscal year 2022 is set at: 750,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of his termination or re-appointment in 2022; and 825,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period between the date of his re-appointment in 2022 and December 31, 2022."
Achieving the target net current cash flow per share announced by Klpierre as guidance to the market grants entitlement to 60% of the fixed annual compensation.
Qualitative component Weighting Capped at 50% of fixed annual compensation.
"Description The qualitative portion of variable compensation is measured by applying several criteria and for 2022 is based around the following topics: Promotion of CSR; Strategy implemented to enhance the quality of the portfolio (developments, investments, disposals); Risk management; Management of human capital."
The overall short-term variable compensation paid to the Chairman of the Executive Board is capped at 150% of his fixed annual compensation as stated in the 2022 compensation policy.
"The Supervisory Board may, in exceptional circumstances and having solicited the opinion of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, use its judgment to adapt and/or amend the criteria and/or calculation scale (upwards or downwards) used to determine the annual short-term variable compensation of the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board, in the event that the impact of such an exceptional circumstance were disproportionate with regard to the fundamental principles of the compensation policy."
"These performance conditions are based on financial, non-financial and operating targets that contribute to the goals of the compensation policy: Conditions that encourage the achievement of the Groups operating and financial targets and thus drive greater value creation for shareholders."
"They therefore promote the alignment of the beneficiaries interests with those of the Company and of its shareholders; Varied and demanding conditions, which differ from those applicable to short-term variable compensation and which are for the most part assessed based on financial and quantitative criteria along with criteria linked to the environmental or social issues facing the Group; Conditions based on Klpierres performance, improvements in which depend on the work put in by the teams and their results, based on an approach designed to create value over the long term."
"In accordance with the compensation policy approved by the Supervisory Board, annual allotments made to the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board may not represent more than 100% of short-term compensation(1) for the Chairman and the members of the Executive Board."

"It is paid subject to the following performance conditions: In the two fiscal years preceding the year of termination of his term of office, the Chairman of the Executive Board received or will be entitled to receive overall annual variable compensation (quantitative plus qualitative) representing an amount equal to at least 100% of his fixed compensation (the maximum being defined according to the applicable compensation policy), and The quantitative portion of the short-term annual variable compensation must, as a minimum, have been paid in an amount equal to the target in said two fiscal years."
"These conditions are directly related to the achievement of the short-term compensation objectives applicable to the Chairman of the Executive Board and are therefore among the basic principles of the compensation policy applicable to the Chairman, taking into account performance related to the Groups commercial strategy."
"In the event of the Chairman of the Executive Boards forced departure, he may be entitled to receive under the package a severance payment in an initial amount of one years annual compensation, calculated The Chairman of the Executive Board has: Use of a company car; The same occupational insurance and healthcare benefits plan as other Group employees in France."
