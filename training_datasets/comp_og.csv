"Executive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with Shells broader policy on pay: In recent years the Group scorecard architecture has been identical tothe Executive Committee and Senior Executive scorecard in terms ofmeasures, weightings and targets."
This consistency means that less explanation of executive remuneration structures is required than in companies where alignment is not the default practice.
"The Directors Remuneration Policy as detailed on pages 189-197 took effectfrom May 19, 2020, after it was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM."
Scorecard targets will be disclosed in the subsequent Directors Remuneration Reportwhen they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive.
"The Directors Remuneration Policy sets out: A summary of proposed changes to the Directors RemunerationPolicy, page 189; Executive Directors Remuneration Policy, pages 190-196; and Non-executive Directors Remuneration Policy, pages 196-197."
"This section describes the Directors Remuneration Policy (Policy) which, following shareholder approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM), came into effect from May 19, 2020, and will be effective until the2023 AGM, unless a further policy is proposed by Shell plc (the Company) and approved by shareholders in the meantime."
"The principles underpinning the REMCOs approach to executive remuneration are the foundation for everything we do, and are: Alignment with Shells strategy: the Executive Directors compensation package should be strongly linked to the achievement of stretching targets that are seen as indicators of the execution of Shells strategy; Pay for performance: the majority of the Executive Directors compensation, (excluding benefits and pensions), should be linked directly to Shells performance through variable pay instruments; Competitiveness: remuneration levels should be determined by reference internally against Shells Senior Management and externally against companies of comparable size, complexity and global scope; Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares inShell; Consistency: the remuneration structure for Executive Directors should generally be consistent with the remuneration structure for Shells Senior Management."
The REMCO also seeks to ensure compliance with applicable laws and corporate governance requirements when designing and implementing policiesand plans; and Risk assessment: the remuneration structures and rewards should meetrisk-assessment tests to ensure that shareholders interests aresafeguarded and that inappropriate actions are avoided.
The Executive Directors remuneration structure is made up of a fixed element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus (50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
"During 2018 and 2019, the REMCO reviewed the Remuneration Policy toensure that the Policy continues to be aligned with Shells strategy, including delivery of shareholder returns."
"REMCO determined that while the current policy remains appropriate in many respects, certain changes will support the REMCO to simplify remuneration structures and address the management of quantum."
Remuneration element Annual Bonus Proposed Changes to Policy Reduction of the CEOs target bonus from 150% to 125%; and Removal of the individual performance factor for Executive Directors.
"Discretion, Malus and Clawback Pension After reviewing the single figure outcomes for the year, the REMCO will consider an adjustment for the purposes of managing remuneration quantum, taking into account performance, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations."
An explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report; Alignment of malus and clawback provisions so that these are the same.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Executive Directors remuneration policy table Purpose and link to strategy Maximum opportunity Salary and pensionable base salary Provides a fixed level of earnings to attract and retain Executive Directors.
"In making salary determinations, the REMCO will consider: the market positioning of the compensation packages; comparison with Senior Management salaries; the employee context, and planned average salary increase for other employees across the Netherlands, the UK and the USA; the experience, skills and performance of the Executive Director, or any change in the scope and responsibility of their role; general economic conditions, Shells financial performance, and governance trends; the impact of salary increases on pension benefits and other elements of the and package."
"This balance ensures that the achievement of short-term financial performance does notundermine future shareholder value creation; Scorecard targets will be disclosed in a subsequent Directors Remuneration Report when they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive; There are no prescribed thresholds or minimum levels of performance that equate toaprescribed payment under the Policy and this structure can result in no bonus being awarded; The annual bonus is subject to malus provisions before it is delivered and to clawback provisions thereafter; The REMCO retains the ability to adjust performance measure targets and weightings year-by-year within the overall target and maximum payouts approved in the Policy; and In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the REMCO will determine their target and maximum bonus, which will not exceed the target andmaximum for the CEO."
"This would be done at the REMCOs discretion after considering single figure outcome for the year, taking into account Shells performance, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations."
"The REMCO retains the right to amend the form of any Executive Directors pension arrangements where appropriate, for example in response to changes in legislation to ensure the original objective of this element of remuneration is preserved."
The comparator companies are reviewed by the REMCO as part of the Remuneration Policy review every three years.
The last review took place in 2019 in preparation for the 2020 Directors Remuneration Policy vote.
The REMCO uses benchmark data from these companies only as a guide to the competitiveness of the remuneration packages.
We do not seek to position our remuneration atany defined point against the benchmarked positions.
"These elements may include transport to and from home and office, the provision of home security, and occasional business-required partner travel, which are generally considered legitimate business expenses rather than components of remuneration."
"In years where the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration inappropriate for any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to the annual bonus outcome or the LTIP vesting outcome forthe purposes of managing remuneration quantum."
"In making any adjustment to the annual bonus or LTIP vesting outcome for this purpose REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, as well as the internal context for other employees."
An explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report.
Shareholding is one of Shells core remuneration principles as it creates a balanced connection between individual wealth and Shells long-term performance.
"Differences for Executive Directors from other employees The remuneration structure and approach to setting remuneration levels is consistent across Shell, with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities."
"However, a higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for Executive Directors and members of Senior Management."
"The salary for each Executive Director is determined based on the indicators in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table, which reflect the international nature of the Executive Directors labour market."
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued Executive Directors retirement benefits are maintained in line with those ofthe wider workforce in their base country.
The REMCO determines the remuneration package for new Executive Director appointments.
"When determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to: attract and motivate candidates of the right quality; take into account the individuals current remuneration package andother contractual entitlements; seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, without overpaying; encourage relocation if required; and honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal candidates before their promotion to the Board."
The REMCO will follow the approach set out in the table below when determining theremuneration package for a new Executive Director.
"The charts on this page represent estimates under four performance scenarios (Minimum, On-target, Maximum and Maximum, assuming a 50% share price appreciation between award and vest) ofthe potential remuneration outcomes for each Executive Director resulting from the application of 2020 base salaries to awards made in accordance with the proposed Policy."
"The majority of Executive Directors remuneration is delivered through variable pay elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching targets."
"The REMCO will review the formulaic Single Figure outcome relative to thequality of performance outcomes and adjust these, taking into account Shells performance, shareholder experience, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant factors, to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only achieved in years with the highest quality performance."
The scenario charts are based on future Policy award levels and are combined with projected single total figures of remuneration.
"Compensation for the forfeiture ofany awards under variable remuneration arrangements Recruitment Remuneration package Approach Component The salary, benefits, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension benefits will be Ongoing remuneration positioned and delivered within the framework of the Executive Directors remuneration policy."
"To facilitate external recruitment, one-off compensation in consideration for forfeited awards under variable remuneration arrangements entered into with a previous employer may be required."
The REMCO will use its judgement to determine the appropriate level of compensation by matching the value of any lost awards under variable remuneration arrangements with the candidates previous employer.
This compensation may take the form of a one-off cash payment or an additional award under the LTIP.
The compensation can alternatively be based on a newly created long-term incentive plan arrangement where the only participant is the new director.
"Theintention is that any such compensation would, as far as possible, align to the duration and structure of the award being forfeited."
There may also be a need to compensate a new Executive Director in respect of forfeitedentitlements other than any awards under variable remuneration arrangements.
"Onrecruitment, these entitlements may be replicated within the Executive Directors remuneration policy or valued by the REMCO and compensated in cash."
"In cases of internal promotion to the Board, any commitments made which cannot be effectively replaced within the Executive Directors remuneration policy may, at the REMCOs discretion, continue to be honoured."
Maximum As stated in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table.
"An amount equal to the value of the forfeited variable remuneration awards, as assessed by the REMCO."
Subject to the limits set out in the Executive Directors remuneration policy table.
"The Netherlands statutory end-of-employment compensation With effect from July 1, 2015, employment legislation in the Netherlands introduced statutory end-of-employment compensation."
"Under this legislation, every termination (other than following retirement or for cause)of a Dutch employment contract that has continued for a minimum of two years will give rise to an obligation to pay the departing employee transition compensation (transitievergoeding)."
"The statutory compensation is capped at one times the annual salary, which is deemed to include variable pay such as the annual bonus."
Executive Directors are expected not to claim transition compensation or any other applicable statutory compensation over and above the agreed compensation for lossof office as set out in the End of employment table on page 196.
"In cases of resignation or dismissal for cause, fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits, and employer pension contributions) will cease on the lastday of employment, variable remuneration elements will generally lapse and the Executive Director is not eligible for compensation for lossofoffice."
"DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued End of employment Provision Compensation for loss of office Annual bonus LTIP Policy For Executive Directors appointed between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016, employment contracts include a cap ontermination payments of one times annual pay (base salary plus target bonus)."
Delivery of compensation is mitigated by acontractual obligation for the Executive Director to seek alternative employment and Shells ability to implement phased paymentterms.
"However, REMCO may be obligated to pay statutory compensation over and above the compensation for loss of office to a departing Executive Director who asserts a statutory claim thereto."
Delivery of compensation ismitigated by a contractual obligation for the Executive Director to seek alternative employment and Shells ability to implement phased payment terms.
"The REMCO may adjust the termination payment for any situation where a full payment is inappropriate, taking into consideration applicable law, corporate governance provisions, the applicability of any statutory compensation and the best interests of Shell andshareholders as a whole."
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Other remuneration Business expenses incurred in respect of the performance of their duties as a NED will be paid or reimbursed by Shell.
"The Chair and the other NEDs cannot receive awards under anyincentive or performance-based remuneration plans, andpersonal loans or guarantees are not granted to them."
Non-executive Directors remuneration policy table Fee structure Non-executive Directors (NEDs) receive a fixed annual fee for their directorship.
Non-executive Director recruitment The REMCOs approach to setting the remuneration package for NEDs is to offer fee levels and specific benefits (where appropriate) in line with the Non-executive Directors remuneration policy table and subject to the Articles of Association.
NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or retention awards.
Consideration of shareholder views The REMCO engages with major shareholders on a regular basis throughout the year and this allows it to hear views on Shells remuneration approach and test proposals when developing or evolving the Policy.
Recent examples of the REMCO responding to shareholder views include: considering the quantum of executive pay and the use ofalternative reward structures; introducing the Energy Transition metric tothe LTIP in line with our strategic ambitions; removing the individual performance modifier from the calculation of annual bonus outcomes tomake remuneration structures simpler and more transparent to shareholders; reducing the CEOs target bonus from 150% to 125%; reducing the CEOs LTIP grant; and enabling the broader use of discretionto manage remuneration outcomes.
"When determining Executive Directors remuneration structure and outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect of remuneration and average salary increases applying in the Netherlands, UK and the USA)."
"The REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources &Corporate Officer and the Executive Vice President Remuneration and HR Operations on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration matters affecting other senior executives, extending to multiple levels below the Board and Executive Committee."
"When setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of the Shell Group, thecurrent balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans, andexisting commitments."

"Obligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which takes into account employees years of service and, for pensions, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and of a duration consistent with the plan obligations."
The unavoidable cost under a contract isthe lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation orpenalties arising from failure to fulfil it.
"The principal assumptions applied in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations and their bases were as follows: rates of increase in pensionable remuneration, pensions in payment and health-care costs: historical experience and managements long-term expectation; discount rates: prevailing long-term AA corporate bond yields, chosen to match the currency and duration of the relevant obligation; and mortality rates: published standard mortality tables for the individual countries concerned adjusted for Shell experience where statistically significant."
The principal share-based employee compensation plans are the PSP and LTIP.
The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 22).
The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is increased by dilutive shares related to share-based compensation plans.
Further information on the remuneration of the Directors can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 166-171.

Share-based compensation plans The fair value of share-based compensation for equity-settled plans granted to employees of subsidiaries under the Companys plans isrecognised as an investment in subsidiaries from the date of grant overthevesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
"If the actual vesting costs are higher than the cumulatively recognised share-based compensation charge, the difference is recognised in income."
"At January 1, 2021 Repurchases of shares Share-based compensation At December 31, 2021 At January 1, 2020 Repurchases of shares Share-based compensation At December 31, 2020 If any amount was paid by Shell Transport or BG by way of a dividend onthe dividend access shares and paid by the Trustee to any holder of Bshares, the dividend which the Company would otherwise have paid onB shares was reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to suchholders of B shares by the Trustee."

"Due to the anticipated achievement of the target for 2022 of gross indebtedness below USD 60 billion, achieved in the third quarter of 2021, in November we approved the improvement of our Shareholder Remuneration Policy."
"We have established our optimal gross debt level of USD60 billion, including commitments related to leasing, and for the purposes of the Shareholder Remuneration Policy, we have adopted a more flexible parameter, applying the gross debt of USD65 billion as a criterion for defining the method of calculating the remuneration to be distributed."
"The policy also establishes that the distribution of remuneration must be made on a quarterly basis and determines a minimum annual remuneration, promoting greater predictability in the flow of payments to shareholders."
The Shareholder Remuneration Policy with all its new parameters for distributing earnings is available on our Investor Relations website.

"Our compensation is defined through a compensation policy approved by the Board of Directors, and represents an instrument for attracting, engaging, and retaining talent, in accordance with the Public Selection Processes (PSPs) for hiring employees and current legislation, being competitive and aligned with our performance culture."
"Our positions and emphases are classified based on the score resulting from the job evaluation process, conducted by a specialized consulting, independent from management, correlated with the result of the compensation survey."
"Regarding direct compensation, market surveys are conducted annually, conducted by specialized consulting firms, such as Willis Towers Watson and the Korn Ferry Hay Group."

This compensation policy was created and implemented in 2007 through collective bargaining with union representatives and approval at employee meetings and was questioned only three years after its implementation.
"However, when calculating compensation, basic and additional wages are considered, such as transportation vouchers, childcare allowances, etc."
"Thus, considering the same position, time with the company, regime and working conditions, the ratio of the average compensation between women and men is equal to 1."
"However, when we analyze it broadly, it is clear that the special work regimes, which have specific additional compensation, impact the average ratio between the compensation of women and men, indicating a small difference."
