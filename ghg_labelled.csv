Definition of Science Based Targets (SBTi) With the help of SBTi and following the complete revision of its carbon footprint in accordance with the GHG Protocol.,1
LOOKING AHEAD Befimmo aims to provide quantitative disclosure on climate-related topics as it incorporates the TCFD recommendations into its business.,1
"Target: fully aligned by 2023 DESCRIPTION AND APPROACH In 2021, Befimmo started to implement the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).",1
"The TCFD structured its recommendations around four themes, namely governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.",0
More details on the TCFD framework and implementations of the recommendations can be found in the Non-financial statements of the present Report.,1

Location based: Our use of the 2021 UK greenhouse gas conversion factors reflect a +3% increase in the GHG intensity of gas (vs 2020) and a +1% increase in the GHG intensity of electricity (vs 2020).,0
Overview SASB table This is British Lands first Sustainability Accounts which references the indicators set out in the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework.,1
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensities for EPRA reporting are also reported in Fig.,1
"For the financial ratio, see GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 Financial Intensity Measures.",1
"Carbon intensity includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions related to these energy sources plus emissions from other building sources such as waste disposal under our management and water consumption.",1
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions financial intensity measures: We publish our financial Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.,1
Financial intensity ratio expresses absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in relation to Gross Rental Income for properties in the managed portfolio.,1
"Absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions relate to managed portfolio electricity, gas use and refrigerant loss from air conditioning, and fuel use in British Land owned vehicles.",1
"Includes 100% of GHG emissions from our developments, joint venture developments and developments undertaken by others with our funding.",0
"GHG conversion emissions factors for 2022 (see Table 4) are sourced from the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategys (BEIS) 2021 guidelines.",0
"This includes the seven main GHG emissions covered by the Kyoto and Greenhouse Gas Protocols, in line with common practice: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).",1
"Emissions are grouped by Scope 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the GHG Protocol, as follows: Scope 1: Combustion of fuels, refrigerant loss.",1
Scope 1 and 2 absolute target: this Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) target is reported by calculating the absolute percentage reduction in the reporting years absolute location-based Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions versus the baseline year of 2020.,1
The reporting years total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are prepared for and sourced from Figure 4.,1
"For the SBTi numerator, the A1-A5 emissions are pro-rated by the duration of the construction project.",1
"B1-B5 emissions (embodied carbon from the operations of managed assets): Currently, these GHG emissions are estimated using industry benchmarks developed by industry expert Simon Sturgis (see table below).",0
We use the location-based method to report our total GHG emissions and track performance against our 2019 baseline.,0
The location-based method was also used for GHG emissions reported in previous years.,0
Table 4 shows the combined carbon-equivalent emission factors for the different GHGs considered.,0
