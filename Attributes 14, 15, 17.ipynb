       " 'While working through the challenges of the pandemic, big systemic social issues including Indigenous reconciliation, racism, and climate change have reached a turning point and are driving more and more companies to act.',\n",
       " 'Suncor has cared about these issues for years, but more recent conversations and events of 2020 and into 2021 have shed an even greater light on the need to do more.',\n",
       " 'We are a successful energy business and our refreshed strategy combines even better business success, including addressing these ESG concerns and opportunities.',\n",
       " 'Our purpose to deliver trusted energy the world needs while caring for each other and the Earth is an important link between our commitment to sustainability, our strategy and how we respond to these global challenges.',\n",
       " 'Weve also made recent investments in companies like LanzaTech, LanzaJet and Enerkem that advance clean and renewable fuels.',\n",
       " 'Electricity Were already a low-emission energy producer through four highly efficient natural-gas-powered cogeneration operations and four wind power assets.',\n",
       " 'We will be an even larger producer over the coming years with investments in new cogeneration and renewable projects that displace more intensive forms of energy that supply the power grid such as coal.',\n",

       " 'And were always looking at further ways to reduce emissions as outlined in our net-zero objective.',\n",
       " 'This includes replacing our aging coke-fired boilers at Base Plant with cogeneration units, accelerating the commercial scale deployment of carbon capture technology through our investment in Svante and Pathways alliance, and testing new thermal-solvent extraction methods that have the potential to significantly reduce emissions as well.',\n",
       " 'Were pursuing many avenues because there wont be only one solution.',\n",

       " 'What do you mean by this?',\n",
       " 'In addition to lowering our base business emissions and expanding low-emissions businesses, its equally important for us to work with customers, suppliers, governments and innovators to support emissions reductions.',\n",
       " 'In some instances, we do this through continued collaboration to develop and deploy clean technologies like sustainable aviation fuel through our partnership with LanzaJet, and turning residential and commercial waste into biofuels through our investments in Enerkem.',\n",
       " 'We can help these valued customers be partners in a net-zero world by understanding their consumption and helping them lower their carbon emissions, for example, by providing lower emission energy choices such as our coast-to-coast Electric Highway of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and by blending renewable fuels into the gasoline and diesel they purchase.',\n",
       " 'There is a lot of discussion on ESG reporting and the need for standard frameworks and metrics.',\n",
       " 'What is Suncors view?',\n",
       " 'In 2020, the worlds largest investors and companies and key regulators recognized the need for improved sustainability disclosure and a simplification of the corporate reporting landscape, and we are moving now in the direction of having global standards.',\n",
