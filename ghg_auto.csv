Our reporting takes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) into account.
"The TCFD has published recommenda-tions for use by companies to help them report transpar-ently on climate risks and opportunities as part of their , which remain voluntary, focus on four core areas: govern-ance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets."
The TCFD recommendations have been a part of the CDP questionnaire since 2018.
"The detailed TCFD Index in the Appendix provides the companys essential information related to climate change in line with the TCFD recommendations, as well as refer-encing further details in the CDP questionnaire."
These references are consistent with Table 1: CDP questions are aligned with TCFD recommendations in Section 3 of the official TCFD report CDP Technical Note on the TCFD Disclosing in line with the TCFDs Recommendations in 2019.
Market-based emissions in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.
"According to the TCFD, climate-related risks can be divided into two major categories."
"For calculation of the scope 2 CO2 emis-sions calculation, the market-based methodology is used in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance issued by the World Resources Institute."
All (100 percent) of Fords 2019 global facility GHG emissions will be third-party verified to a limited level of assurance in conformance with ISO -1:2018.
Our responsibility for reducing GHG emissions starts withthe use of our vehicles.
"We are working to develop targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (use of sold products)."
We are pursuing vehicle-use CO2 targets consistent with carbon neutrality and the SBTi.
"In an effort to increase transparency about the resiliency of our climate change strategies, weve produced our second Climate Change Scenario Report in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to which we are now formally committed."
"At the event, Bob Holycross, Vice President, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer, spoke about Fords vision for a more sustainable future, including our GHG framework with California."
GHG (CO2EQ) SAVINGS VS.
"To achieve our current target an 18 percent absolute reduction in operational GHG footprint by our Plant Energy Team focuses our efforts on securing a reliable supply of energy for our manufacturing plants, making those facilities more efficient and collecting, storing and managing data and analytics."
"We report our GHG emissions, participate in emissions trading schemes and adhere to a number of carbon reduction initiatives in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil and other countries."

Verification data is not yet available for Fords 2019 global facility greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
"As completed for 2018, 100 percent of Fords 2019 GHG emissions from our operations will be third-party verified to a limited level of assurance in accordance with ISO -3."
We have targets approved by SBTi as well as internal targets with our suppliers.
Our responsibility for reducing GHG emissions starts with the use of our vehicles.
These targets do not include offsets and are strictly GHG reduction targets.
"How We Developed Our Current Approach For over a decade, we have used climate science-based GHG pathways for our light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and operations."
We used the SBTi modeling tools to set our targets.
"Our 2035 well-below 2C vehicle GHG targets for LDVs, light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and medium-and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) are calculated using the SBTi Sectoral Decarbonization Approach modeling tool."
These targets have been approved by SBTi.
"As these factors change, and as climate science develops, we will further refine and adjust our science-based GHG targets."
Our vehicle development plans are aligned with our metrics for reducing GHG emissions.
"In an effort to increase transparency about the resiliency of our climate change strategies, in 2020 we produced our second Climate Change Scenario Report in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to which we have formally committed."
"See our TCFD Index for more information Voluntary Framework Agreement with California We are working to accelerate the transition through advocacy and deep decarbonization of our value chain, including battery electric vehicles (BEVs), switching to renewable electricity and working with our customers and suppliers to reduce their emissions."
"We have been recognized for our leadership in negotiating the agreement, and in standing for Californias right to regulate GHGs and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)."
"In terms of GHG impact, the use of products is the main source of vehicle emissions."
"Our emissions calculation methodology was updated in 2020 to follow the GHG Protocol and now represents on-road well-to-wheels CO2e over a 241,000 km lifetime."
"Compared to conventional gasoline (E10) vehicles, GHG emissions are about 15 percent lower for diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, 25 percent lower for B20 (20 percent biodiesel blend) and 30 percent lower for E85 (85 percent ethanol from corn)."
"We achieved our previous GHG emissions target eight years early, through initiatives such as installing LED lights and updating our painting operations."
"To better understand our suppliers GHG emissions and water use, we survey a selection of them every year using the CDP Supply Chain programs Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires."
"Our Scope 3 product footprint, which consists of our supply chain impacts, use of vehicles produced and management of vehicles end-of-life, amounts to 94 percent of GMs total GHG emissions for 2019."
"Scientists tell us that we have about 10 years to sharply reduce global GHG emissions, and achieving that will take significant work that needs to begin now."

"EPA and NHTSA have issued two joint fnal rules governing GHG and fuel economy, respectively, for light-duty vehicles, covering model years 2012 through 2025."
The EPA and NHTSA conducted a mid-term review to evaluate the appropriateness of model year 2022-2025 CAFE/GHG standards and the original assumptions the agencies made as a basis for those standards.
"In September 2019, EPA and NHTSA issued a new Joint Rule that prohibits California from having a GHG program."
"FCA LATAM CARBON NEUTRAL PROGRAM Focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the FCA LATAM Carbon Neutral Program aims to measure, manage, reduce and offset the annual GHG emissions produced from the daily activities of the regional plants."

SASB Content Index This Report has been prepared in accordance with the SASB Transportation Standard.
Key: The following table lists content within the document that relates to specific SASB Standards indicators.
"In addition, Stellantis implements SASB Transportation standard and commits to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ; targeting a sustainable double-digit Adjusted Operating Income margins in the mid-term (~2026)."
"The following sections of this Climate Report detail the strategy implemented by Stellantis including the governance, and the actions to achieve the targets, following the recommendations of the Task force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
Stellantis is determined not only to be compliant with applicable GHG regulations around the globe but to lead the way as a green company.
"To establish its targets, Stellantis referred to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology, based on Sector Decarbonization Approach for transport sector."
"Among other matters, it deals with GHG-related governmental enforcement and private litigations."
The objective is to reduce production cost and prices of such e-fuels and to develop direct air capture of CO2 to optimize GHG balance.
Stellantis was also recognized by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program with a Gold Seal for completing and certifying the GHG emissions inventory.
"The coefficients proposed by these two regulations are derived from the work of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), as are those of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, used as a reference by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)."
Logistics Stellantis logistics operations policy A specific policy is defined to reduce GHG emissions from logistics and identify areas of improvement and actions needed.
GEFCO is aligned with the European Standard EN and the GHG protocol for accounting its carbon emissions and supported by EcoTransIT World to exchange data for each traffic flow and by mode of transport.
A specific policy is defined to reduce GHG emissions from logistics and identify areas of improvement and actions needed.
We will continue to promote calculating and managing GHG emissions.
