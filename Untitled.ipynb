WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GärtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signiﬁcance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the ﬁrst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG – it stands for the “S“ in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed  – just underscored – the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM’s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reﬂected in the focus on green building, green ﬁnancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conﬁrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the ﬁrst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signiﬁcance of ESG for UBM – also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c4\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\n\\nsummarised in four words:  \\n\\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\n\\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\n\\nIt represents the focal point  \\n\\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\n\\nvarious aspects of  \\n\\nsustainability in connection  \\n\\nwith the Environment,  \\n\\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n66\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n7\\n7\\n\\n1.

Our business model.  \\nExplained in brief.\\n\\ngreen.  smart.  and  more.  That  summarises  the  strategy  of \\nUBM  Development  AG  in  four  words.  Explained  in  brief. \\nBecause  anyone  who  plans  for  the  future  must  develop \\nbuildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically \\nappealing, where people feel well. \\n\\nnow  the  determining  factors  for  our  actions.  In  2021  UBM \\napplied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-\\nmitted  to  compliance  with  the  UN  Sustainable  Develop-\\nment  Goals,  and  became  an  ofﬁcial  supporter  of  the  Task \\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\n\\nWe  develop  properties  for  Europe’s  major  cities.  In  line \\nwith our core strategy, the focus is on green building and \\nsmart ofﬁce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, \\nMunich  and  Prague.  With  over  150  years  of  experience, \\nUBM provides a full range of development services – from \\nplanning to marketing – from a single source.\\n\\nEcological and social aspects play an important role in every \\ndecision  because  our  actions  today  design  the  working \\nand living space of tomorrow. Gold from EcoVadis, Prime  \\nStatus from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-\\ntiﬁcations  in  recent  years  underscore  UBM’s  commitment \\nto sustainability. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic signiﬁcantly increased the pace of \\nchange in this area. Ecological and social sustainability are \\n\\nUBM  Development  AG  is  listed  in  the  prime  market  seg-\\nment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets \\nthe  highest  transparency  standards.  That  not  only  means \\nﬁnancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all \\nother aspects of the business model.\\n\\nUBM’s corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but \\nits activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-\\ntan regions in ﬁve countries – Germany, Austria, the Czech \\nRepublic,  Poland  and  the  Netherlands.  In  many  of  these \\nmarkets,  UBM  has  been  active  as  a  real  estate  developer \\nfor many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner \\n– not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-\\nties and ﬁnancing banks.\\n\\n2-1, 2-6\\n\\nT E A M   P E R F O R M A N C E   A L O N G   T H E   E N T I R E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nPlanning and \\nengineering\\n\\nProject \\nmanagement\\n\\nFinancing\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n \\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nProperties for Europe‘s metropolises.  \\nSustainable, technologically and emotionally \\nintelligent and with added value. \\n\\nU B M   I N   E U R O P E\\n\\nThe Hague\\n\\nHamburg\\n\\nDüsseldorf\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nFrankfurt\\n\\nPrague\\n\\nMunich\\n\\nVienna\\n\\nInnsbruck\\n\\nGraz\\n\\nWarsaw\\n\\nKatowice\\n\\nKrakow\\n\\n8\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nEvery decision we make in connection with the development \\nof a property has an impact on the global climate for the \\ncoming decades. It is a conviction that is also reflected in \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. \\n\\n1.2. Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand  setting  a  value  for  the  sale  which  can  be  included  in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\nproﬁtability and risk. UBM’s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a “one-stop shop“. We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management, ﬁnancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor ﬁnal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM’s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and ofﬁce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM’s  core  markets  is  also  well-ﬁlled  for  the \\nfuture  with  €2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nofﬁce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue  of  roughly  €300m  in  its  standing  investment  portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM’s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n“Pure  Play  Developer“.  Nearly  75%  of  the  company’s  book \\nvalue is attributable to development.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\nU B M   –   C O R E   C O M P E T E N C E\\n\\nsell with  \\nadded value\\n\\ndevelop\\n\\n10\\n\\nbuy\\n\\n \\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nT H E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nS\\n\\nN\\n\\nT I O\\n\\nA\\n\\nR\\n\\nAsset \\nmanagement\\n\\nE\\n\\nP\\n\\nO\\n\\n Acquisition\\n\\nZoning / \\nbuilding rights\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nP\\n\\nT\\n\\nI\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nI\\n\\nT\\n\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nI\\n\\nL\\n\\nA\\n\\nE\\n\\nR\\n\\nSale / \\nexit\\n\\nRental / \\nmarketing\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n        Financing\\n\\nS\\n\\nT\\n\\nR\\n\\nU\\n\\nCTIO N\\n\\n1.3.  Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM‘s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nreﬂected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe ﬁrst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the ﬁnancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM’s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM’s strate-\\ngic transformation into a “Pure Play Developer“, the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated – for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a “Pure Play Developer“, UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering – in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different  ﬁelds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate qualiﬁcations. There were no signiﬁcant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.  International presence  \\n\\nand stable shareholder structure \\n\\nUBM Development and its subsidiaries have an efﬁcient \\nlocal network which guarantees competitive positioning in \\nthe individual markets. In addition to the headquarters of \\nUBM Development AG in Vienna, the following operating \\nsubsidiaries are active in real estate development: \\n\\n(cid:132) \\n\\n UBM Development Deutschland GmbH and  \\nAlba Bau Projekt Management GmbH (Germany) \\n\\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Österreich GmbH (Austria) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Czechia s.r.o. (Czech Republic) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Polska sp.z o.o. (Poland) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Netherlands B.V. (Netherlands)\\n\\nThere were no signiﬁcant changes in the organisation dur-\\ning 2021. \\n\\nThe  share  capital  of  UBM  Development  AG  totalled \\n€22,416,540  as  of  31  December  2021  and  is  divided  into \\n7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising the IGO-Ortner \\nGroup and the Strauss Group held an unchanged 38.8% of \\nthe  shares  outstanding  at  year-end  2021.  In  addition,  the \\nIGO-Ortner  Group  held  6.8%  of  UBM  outside  the  syndi-\\ncate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a pri-\\nvate investor. Free ﬂoat comprised 49.4% of the shares and \\nincluded  the  3.9%  of  the  shares  held  by  the  Management \\nand  Supervisory  Boards.  Most  of  the  other  free  ﬂoat  was \\nheld by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%). \\n\\n2-1, 2-2, 2-9\\n\\n1.5. Teamwork, also at the top  \\n\\nCooperation  is  not  only  a  guiding  principle  for  UBM,  but \\nalso  a  quality  valued  by  top  management.  The  four-mem-\\nber Management Board – Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin \\nLöcker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO) and Martina Maly-Gärtner \\n(COO)  –  is  supported  by  the  Executive  Committee  as  an \\nextended management body.\\nThe  Executive  Committee  includes  the  four  Management \\nBoard members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-\\ntry  and  specialist  managers.  The  committee  meets  six  to \\neight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure \\ncontinuous calibration. The members of the Executive Com-\\nmittee,  in  total,  have  invested  approximately  €5m  in  UBM \\nshares and participate at 5% in an increase in the company’s \\nvalue through stock options.\\n\\nSustainability is an issue for management.  \\nBut not only. \\nThe  assignment  of  responsibilities  proves  that  sustain- \\nability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter \\nfor  management.  The  Management  Board  is  responsible \\nfor the organisation of and compliance with sustainability \\nissues.  Thomas  G.  Winkler,  the  Chief  Executive  Ofﬁcer,  is \\nin  charge  of  the  sustainability-relevant  areas  of  strategy, \\ninvestor  relations  &  ESG,  and  compliance.

The  Executive \\nCommittee regularly deals with sustainability issues, espe-\\ncially  in  view  of  the  new  strategic  focus  on  green.  smart. \\nand more. \\n\\nUBM became one of the ﬁrst listed companies in Austria to \\nestablish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board in \\nFebruary 2021. As the senior controlling body, the Super-\\nvisory Board is now able to meet its responsibilities for the \\nenvironment, society and governance through a separate \\ncommittee.  The  ESG  Committee  deals  with  the  analysis \\nof sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts \\nin  corporate  processes  –  in  particular,  it  deﬁnes  the  most \\n\\n12\\n\\n \\n\\x0cimportant  ESG  factors  that  are  deter-\\nmined by the company’s sector afﬁliation \\nand  business  model  and  are  subject  to \\nregional inﬂuence.\\nThe  ESG  Committee  monitors  and  sup-\\nports  activities  in  line  with  the  ESG  cat-\\nalogue  of  measures  based  on  the  clear \\nassignment  of  responsibilities  at  Man-\\nagement  Board  and  Supervisory  Board \\nlevels.  It  also  supervises  and  evaluates \\nthe implemented ESG measures – above \\nall,  the \\nimpact  of  procurement  and \\ndevelopment  processes  on  ecosystems, \\nthe use of resources, the direct and indi-\\nrect  neighbourhood,  and  good  corpo-\\nrate  management.  Additional  informa-\\ntion on the ESG Committee can be found \\nin the Annual Report for 2021 under the \\nCorporate  Governance  Report  starting \\non page 88. \\nThe  inclusion  of  ESG  factors  in  the  remu-\\nneration  model  will  be  analysed  in  detail \\nin the future: Plans call for the integration \\nof  key  ESG  performance  indicators  in \\nmanagement’s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\nFurther information on the Supervisory Board and Manage-\\nment Board is provided in the Annual Report for 2021 under \\nthe Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88. \\n\\nShared values as the basis  \\nMany projects in many different countries – that demands a \\ncommon basis to make sure everyone pulls together. At UBM, \\nthis  means  a  clear  strategic  focus  and  shared  values.  The \\nfoundation is created by a system of values that is based on \\nthree  pillars:  competent.  consequent.  transparent.  Speciﬁ-\\ncally, that means: UBM stands for high technical competence, \\nconsequent actions and full transparency.  \\n\\n2-9, 2-13, 2-19, 2-22\\n\\n13\\n\\n Martina Maly-Gärtner (COO) , \\nThomas G. Winkler (CEO),  \\nMartin Löcker (COO), \\nPatric Thate (CFO), f.l.t.r.\\n\\nBased on these deﬁned values,  \\nwe have formulated the following binding goals:\\n\\none goal \\nstands for an increase in the value of the company. \\n\\none team  \\nexpresses the goal to grow even closer together  \\nas a corporate group. \\n\\none company  \\nreﬂects the clear understanding to deal with the \\noutside world as a single entity. \\n\\n\\x0cU B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.6. Financial performance indicators\\n\\nBusiness development and earnings\\nWith after-tax proﬁt of €44m, UBM closed the 2021 ﬁnan-\\ncial  year  with  results  that  exceeded  expectations  at  the \\nstart  of  the  second  pandemic  year.  This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.

This  increase \\nwas based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash \\nreceivables, which grew by €176.1m to €423.3m. \\n\\nEquity  totalled  €550.6m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31 \\nDecember  2020:  €482.9m)  and  was  increased  primarily \\nby the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30–35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was ﬁnalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.  Nearly  50%  of  the \\n2018  hybrid  bond  was  redeemed  prematurely,  and  this \\nﬁnancing was extended to 2026. \\n\\nBond  liabilities  totalled  €526.5m  at  the  end  of  December \\n2021 and were €70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-\\nvious  year  (31  December  2020:  €456.5m).

This  indicator  represents  current  and  non-cur-\\nrent  bonds  and  ﬁnancial  liabilities,  excluding  lease  liabil-\\nities,  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  decline  in  net \\ndebt  resulted,  above  all,  from  distributions  from  equity- \\naccounted  companies,  property  sales  and  an  increase  in \\nﬁnancial liabilities as support for investments.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cUBM IN DETAIL16\\x0cUBM IN DETAILESG – which stands for Environment, Social, Governance – is an integral part  of our strategy.

As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market. UBM shares are listed in Vienna‘s Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments ﬁts per-fectly with UBM’s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our ﬁnancing to green ﬁnancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ﬁve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond ﬁnancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the ﬁrst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ﬁve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM’s commitment to reach a speciﬁc ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green ﬁnancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green ﬁnancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit ﬁnancing represents the next step to even more green ﬁnancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for “green loans“. Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate ﬁnancing. Over the longer term, we also see “green bonds“ as attrac-tive tools for green ﬁnancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speciﬁc use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien für Europas Metropolen.

Sustainability  not only demands an ecological approach  but also socially farsighted thinking. We are working, step by step, to build  a UBM that also leads the way with  high social competence. As an employer,  we support cooperation and fairness.  As a developer, we create innovative  building concepts for generations to come.  And as a good corporate citizen, we live  our responsibility to society.UBM IN DETAIL27\\x0c2828The DIY developerSocial aspects are just as important for green thinking. As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our ofﬁces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM’s training and educational programmes as well as our “UBM Day”, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That’s more than all trafﬁc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Efﬁcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out. UBM IN DETAILUBM Day A \"green“ event for more than 200 of our colleaguesUBM Day Teamwork in progressUBM Day Teamwork in progressUBM Team Common sense\\x0c2929Two days of pure UBM cultureMore than 200 of our colleagues from Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria took part in our “UBM Day“ 2021 in Vienna at the end of October. The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community “live“. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the ﬁrst time as a “green meeting“ in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements – from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering ﬁrm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the “Caritas am Himmel“ during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the “Lichtblickhof“ brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na‘s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations – and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM’s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead, €50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria’s only stationary children’s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in difﬁcult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children‘s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankeschön\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM‘s underground car park\\x0c3131UBM IN DETAILDay in the other UBM countries as a ﬁxed part of our schedule starting in 2022. “smart“ and “green travelling“ as education In October 2021, roughly 30 of our colleagues travelled to Berlin to learn about the realisation of smart ofﬁce building ideas on site and, above all, to also experience the UBM community outside the ofﬁce. A number of colleagues involved with UBM’s “green“ strategy took a trip to the Austrian province of Vorarl-berg at the same time, where they reviewed model pro-jects and workshops for timber construction. The participants in both trips gained new impressions and valuable impulses for their future work and for cooperation throughout the UBM Group. Keeping ﬁt at the Business RunA team of 21 UBM employees also took part in the annual Busi-ness Run in Vienna’s Prater in 2021. After successfully complet-ing the 4.1 kilometres, the hobby athletes met in the nearby Mehler restaurant for refreshments, a chat and networking.Berlin Case study: \"smart.\"Berlin  Team buildingVorarlberg Case study: \"green.\"Vorarlberg With \"Timber Pope\" Hermann Kaufmann2-23, 3-3\\x0c32UBM IN DETAIL32\\x0c32UBM IN DETAIL3233 OVERNANCE, meaning  good corporate management,  represents a competitive factor for UBM. In addition to the environment and  social issues, good governance has come  to play a greater role in the perception  and valuation of companies. UBM recognised  this long ago and has also ﬁrmly anchored  good corporate management at the ESG level.UBM IN DETAIL33\\x0cU B M   I N   D E T A I L\\n\\nGood ratings.\\nGreat opportunities.\\n\\nA number of inﬂuential players have established a position \\nas intermediaries between ESG requirements and the cap-\\nital  market.  In  addition  to  shareholders  and  banks,  rating \\nagencies,  analysts  and  international  institutional  investors \\nare becoming more and more important. One key example \\nis  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI),  which  has  deﬁned \\nbinding  global  guidelines  for  the  preparation  of  sustain-\\nability  reports.  UBM,  as  an  international  company,  already \\nreports in accordance with the latest GRI standards to pro-\\nvide  decision-makers  with  comparable  information  and \\nunderstandable performance indicators. \\n\\nClear criteria and responsibilities \\nThe  ESG  Committee  has  wide-ranging  responsibilities.  It \\nanalyses sustainability criteria and corporate social respon-\\nsibility  concepts  in  corporate  processes  and  deﬁnes  the \\nmost  important  ESG  factors  based  on  industry  afﬁliation, \\nbusiness  model  and  regional  inﬂuences.  The  committee \\nalso  clariﬁes  responsibilities  at  Management  Board  and \\nSupervisory Board levels. It monitors and evaluates the ESG \\nmeasures  set  by  UBM  –  and,  for  example,  regularly  exam-\\nines and documents the effects of employment and devel-\\nopment processes.\\n\\nAn ESG Committee at the highest level\\nESG  issues  deserve  the  greatest  possible  attention.  At \\nUBM, that means they are an issue for the boss. For exam-\\nple: the ESG reporting by the UBM Management Board to \\nthe  Supervisory  Board  goes  far  beyond  standard  informa-\\ntion. An ESG Committee was established especially for this \\npurpose  and  is  comparable  to  the  Audit  Committee  that \\nreviews UBM’s ﬁnancial reporting.\\n\\nThe integrity of our customers is regularly reviewed with a \\nso-called “KYC (Know Your Customer) check“. Routine train-\\ning courses are also held on the prevention of money laun-\\ndering.  “Compliance“  –  in  other  words,  the  observance  of \\nlegally required standards, especially on the capital market \\n– is given great attention. It’s therefore no surprise that UBM \\nrepeatedly receives very high marks for governance in the \\nESG ratings.\\n\\n2-9, 2-23, 3-3\\n\\n34\\n34\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0cIn February 2021, UBM became one of the \\nﬁrst listed companies in Austria to establish \\nan ESG Committee for the Supervisory \\nBoard.

Our strategy \\n\\nProtecting  the  future  viability  of  our  planet  is  one  of  the \\nmost important social responsibilities of our time. With the \\nannouncement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-\\nscored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral \\ncontinent in the world by 2050. Other megatrends apart from \\necology are urbanisation and the demographic and social \\nshifts in the social order. “Silver Society“ describes the age-\\ning of society, in which health and the quality of life will be \\ndeeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. \\nChanging gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes \\nhave also led to radical changes in society and the business \\nsector. These developments, together with COVID-19, are the \\ndecisive factors for the megatrend “New Work” – meaning \\npeople’s needs as regards their working world.\\n\\nWe see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an \\nopportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor \\nfor  our  entrepreneurial  actions.  In  the  sense  of  ecological \\nsustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-\\nber  construction  developers  in  Europe.  Our  actions  today \\nare already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-\\nible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s \\nusers. As  a  real  estate  developer,  we  can  give  the  office  a \\nnew  standing  as  a  communication  and  collaboration  plat-\\nform  –  the  physical  workplace  then  becomes  a  place  for \\ncommunity and corporate culture. As an employer, we also \\ntake  advantage  of  these  opportunities  –  for  example,  by  \\nbenefitting from the additional innovation potential created \\nby a diverse workforce. \\n\\nUBM  has  anchored  the  relevance  of  ESG  in  its  corporate \\nstrategy through the focus on green. smart. and more. and is \\nintroducing concrete measures. The efficient use of resources \\nis an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues \\nand adherence to compliance rules. UBM’s flagship projects, \\ngreen building certifications and the activities evolving from \\nthe green. smart. and more. strategy reflect the requirements \\nof the EU and create new opportunities for UBM.\\n\\ngreen. stands for measures in support of greening, meaning \\nthe redirection of the economy in line with the environment. \\nOur primary focus is on timber construction as well as renew-\\nable energies and green building certification.\\n\\nsmart.  expresses  our  commitment  to  intelligent  buildings. \\nWith the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be \\nadapted to meet the needs of users and, at the same time, \\noperations can be made more efficient.\\n\\nand  more.  means  we  tell  stories  with  our  buildings.  This \\ninvolves aesthetics, well-being and customer experience – a \\n“more“ that is perceptible all over.\\n\\nOur  sustainability  activities  are  based  on  the  applicable \\nrules and regulations in the countries where we are active. \\nFor example: government programmes in the countries rel-\\nevant for UBM cover issues like the expansion of renewable \\nenergy, the efficient use of energy, subsidy programmes for \\nenvironmentally  friendly  behaviour  and  the  strengthening \\nof fundamental and human rights, especially in the supply \\nchain. An additional framework is provided by national and \\nsupranational norms and standards, including the UN Global \\nCompact,  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the  EU \\nGreen Deal and the EU Taxonomy. We have implemented – \\nand regularly evaluate and improve – the necessary processes \\nto realise our ESG goals and related measures.

In  addition,  the \\nWorks Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Aus-\\ntrian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number \\nof members to the Supervisory Board. The Annual General \\nMeeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the \\nend of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple \\nmajority  of  the  votes  cast. The  Supervisory  Board  elects  a \\nchairman and one or more deputies from among its mem-\\nbers each year at a meeting held after the Annual General \\nMeeting. The Supervisory Board can form committees from \\namong its members, which can be established as permanent \\nbodies or for individual tasks.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected \\nby the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members \\ndesignated by the Works Council as employee representa-\\ntives. The table on the following page shows the members \\nelected to the Supervisory Board in 2019.

Furthermore, UBM intro-\\nduced a stock option programme for key managers and the \\nManagement Board in 2017.\\n\\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for the follow-\\ning duties in connection with the current remuneration policy \\nand in accordance with applicable legal regulations: (i) mat-\\nters related to the remuneration of the Management Board \\nmembers and the content of the employment contracts with \\nthese persons, in particular, the definition and implementa-\\ntion of the underlying principles for the remuneration of the \\nManagement Board members and the criteria for the variable \\nremuneration components in line with Rules 27 (above all, \\nthe  preparation  of  a  catalogue  for  the  variable  remunera-\\ntion components), 27a and 28 of the Austrian Code of Cor-\\nporate Governance; (ii) evaluating the remuneration policy \\nfor  the  Management  Board  members  at  regular  intervals; \\n(iii) approving the assumption of side-line activities by the \\nManagement Board members. The Remuneration Committee \\nheld two meetings during the reporting year. Consultations \\nat the meeting on 26 March 2021 included the determination \\nof the annual bonus for the members of the Management \\n\\nBoard. At the meeting on 24 June 2021, the granting of a \\nspecial bonus to Management Board members Patric Thate \\nand Martin Löcker was discussed. The members of the Remu-\\nneration Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), \\nIris Ortner and Susanne Weiss (remuneration expert).\\n\\nEach  Supervisory  Board  member  receives  an  annual  pay-\\nment  for  his  or  her  services  as  well  as  reimbursement  of \\nexpenses  and  an  attendance  fee  for  each  meeting.  The \\namount of the attendance fee and the annual payment are \\ndetermined by the Annual General Meeting. A resolution by \\nthe  Annual  General  Meeting  on  29  May  2019  established \\nthe following remuneration for members of the Supervisory \\nBoard: the chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed \\nremuneration of €50,000.00 per year, the deputy chairman \\nof the Supervisory Board fixed remuneration of €40,000.00 \\nper  year  and  the  other  members  fixed  remuneration  of \\n€30,000.00 per year. The attendance fee for meetings was set \\nat €2,000.00 per meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of \\nits committees. The Supervisory Board members appointed \\nby the Works Council in accordance with Section 110 Para. 1 \\nof the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act do not receive any \\nadditional payment for their work on the Supervisory Board. \\nGRI 2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 2-12, 2-13, 2-15, 2-16, 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-24\\n\\n3.3.

Gross  risks  were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n \\x1f Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer & training and education\\n \\x1f Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of “double materiality“, meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company’s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM’s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe  major  issues  for  UBM  were  redefined  in  2021  as  part \\nof  a  materiality  analysis  based  on  these  three  dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n \\x1f UBM’s impact on people, society and the environment \\n \\x1f The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n \\x1f The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM’s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\n47\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c \\x1f “Water consumption“ and “waste“ were combined \\n\\nunder “water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations“. \\n\\n \\x1f The new issue “sustainable procurement and regional \\n\\nadded value“ covers “social criteria in the supply chain“, \\n“ecological criteria in the supply chain“ and “regional \\neconomy & society“. \\n\\n \\x1f “Infrastructure and mobility“, which was previously \\n\\nincluded under “socio-cultural environment of projects“, \\nwas recorded separately.\\n\\n \\x1f The former issue “cooperations“ is still an integral part \\nof UBM’s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2\\n\\nThe results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading. The matrix shows all three dimensions and is ori-\\nented on the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft as \\nwell as the GRI standards 2021. The three material issues for \\nUBM are described in detail in the following sections, and the \\nother issues are also explained. \\n\\nThere  were  a  number  of  changes  in  comparison  with  the \\nmateriality analysis from 2020:\\n\\n \\x1f “Energy consumption“ and “GHG (greenhouse gases)“ \\nwere combined under the material issue “energy  \\nefficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions“. \\n \\x1f “Fair working conditions“ and “employee training  \\n\\nand education“ were assigned to the material issue \\n“attractive employer & training and education“. \\n \\x1f “Ethics & compliance“ was renamed “corporate  \\n\\ngovernance and compliance” and identified as a  \\nmaterial issue. \\n\\n \\x1f “Users’ well-being“ and “incentives for environmentally \\n\\nfriendly behaviour“ were split off into “customer  \\norientation and creating awareness“ and “healthy  \\nbuilding materials and quality of life“. \\n\\n \\x1f “Digitalisation and technology“ was expanded to \\n\\ninclude innovation (“innovation and technologies“). \\n \\x1f “Adaptation to climate change“ and “biodiversity“  \\n\\nwere combined into a single issue (“ground sealing, \\nadaptation to climate change and biodiversity“). \\n \\x1f “Urban quarter development“ and “socio-cultural  \\nenvironment of projects“ were combined under  \\n“architecture, urban quarter development and social \\ndiversity“. \\n\\n47\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0cM A T E R I A L I T Y   M A T R I X\\n\\ni\\n\\nh\\ng\\nh\\ny\\nr\\ne\\nv\\n\\ne\\nv\\ni\\nt\\nc\\ne\\np\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\nr\\ne\\nd\\no\\nh\\ne\\nk\\na\\nt\\ns\\ne\\nh\\nt\\n\\nl\\n\\nm\\no\\nr\\nf\\ne\\nc\\nn\\na\\nv\\ne\\ne\\nR\\n\\nl\\n\\ne\\nt\\na\\nr\\ne\\nd\\no\\nm\\n\\nMaterial in the sense of GRI and CSRD  \\nare dark green squares and  \\ntopics with beige background. \\n\\nEnergy efﬁciency, \\nrenewable energies  \\n& CO2 emissions\\n\\nRecyclability  \\n& durability of  \\nbuilding materials\\n\\nHealthy building  \\nmaterials & quality of life\\n\\nMobility &  \\ninfrastructure  \\n\\nCorporate governance  \\n& compliance\\n\\nRefurbishment  \\n& revitalisation\\n\\nInnovation &  \\ntechnologies\\n\\nGround sealing,  \\nadaptation to climate \\nchange & biodiversity\\n\\nSustainable procurement  \\n& regional added value\\n\\nWater & wastewater \\nutilisation, waste in \\nbuilding operations\\n\\nAttractive employer  \\n& training and education\\n\\nDiversity &  \\nequal opportunities\\n\\nCustomer orientation  \\n& creating awareness\\n\\nOccupational  \\nhealth & safety\\n\\nArchitecture,  \\nurban quarter \\ndevelopment  \\n& social diversity\\n\\nmoderate\\n\\nImpact on the environment and society\\n\\nvery high\\n\\nThe relevance for UBM  \\nis assigned as follows:\\n\\nmoderate\\n\\nhigh\\n\\nvery high\\n\\n48\\n\\n49\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c3.5.

Conscious handling of risks and  \\n\\ntheir effects\\n\\nThe  realistic  assessment  and  management  of  risks  repre-\\nsent an essential factor for business success and sustainable \\nmanagement.  One  related  step  was  the  announcement  in \\n2021 of UBM’s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.).  The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM’s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart.  and  more.  corporate  strategy.  Given  the  substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings  (according  to  the  respective  national  definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\n57\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir  activities  on  the  environment.  Economic  success  and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success – and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn  the  course  of  general  risk  management,  the  probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM’s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM  has  defined  measures  and  indicators  for  assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance. The main goals are described on page \\n39, the details on page 50. Further information can be found \\nin the following sections. \\n\\nSustainable management is the  \\nbasis for economic success – and  \\neconomic success is the basis for  \\nsustainable management.\\n\\n57\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0cThe following environmental risks are relevant for UBM: \\n\\nSustainability issues\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nMeasures\\n\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies  \\nand CO2 emissions\\n\\nRecyclability and durability of  \\nbuilding materials\\n\\nGround sealing, climate change  \\nadjustments and biodiversity\\n\\n \\x1f Increasing regulations for emissions,  \\nenergy efficiency and other relevant \\ntopics\\n\\n \\x1f Rising CO2 prices for fossil fuels\\n\\n \\x1f Delivery shortages, increased  \\n\\ncompetition and rising material costs\\n\\n \\x1f Increasing regulations for building \\n\\nmaterials\\n\\n \\x1f High water and flooding due to  \\n\\nground sealing \\n\\n \\x1f Increasing temperature,  \\n\\nheat islands\\n\\n \\x1f Strategic focus on timber construction, \\n\\nrenewable energies and green  \\nbuilding certifications\\n\\n \\x1f Installation/Optimisation of building \\nmanagement systems in standing \\nassets and at UBM locations \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluation of timber in the selection \\nof materials for all new development \\nprojects\\n\\n \\x1f Include circular economy requirements \\n\\nin the planning stage \\n\\n \\x1f Focus on brownfield developments\\n \\x1f Focus on biodiversity in designing \\n\\noutdoor facilities\\n\\n \\x1f Expansion of biological diversity \\n\\nthrough roof and facade greening \\n\\nRefurbishment and revitalisation\\n\\n \\x1f Strict requirements for building demoli-\\n\\n \\x1f Green building certification, also  \\n\\ntion and correct material recycling \\n\\nfor refurbishment projects\\n\\nHealthy building materials and the  \\nquality of life\\n\\n \\x1f Increased minimum requirements for \\n\\nthe healthy quality of building materials\\n\\n \\x1f Green building certification\\n \\x1f Use of timber \\n\\nWater and wastewater utilisation and \\nwaste in building operations\\n\\n \\x1f Reduced water supplies for building \\n\\noperations and the upstream  \\nconstruction industry due to  \\ndry periods (climate change) \\n\\n \\x1f Increasing costs for waste disposal\\n\\n \\x1f Green building certification \\n \\x1f Established waste concepts and  \\ntargeted measures for water and  \\nwastewater utilisation\\n\\n58\\n\\n59\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c3.6.2. Social risks\\nWe view our responsibility as an employer, contracting firm, \\nbusiness  partner  and  integral  part  of  our  social  system  as \\na  central  element  of  our  economic  actions. The  realisation \\nof our projects is dependent to a significant degree on our \\nemployees.  For  that  reason,  UBM  places  high  priority  on \\nattracting  motivated,  committed  and  qualified  employees, \\ngiving them opportunities for development and creating an \\nattractive working environment.\\n\\nOur success is also based on our proven quality as a business \\npartner and contracting firm that acts with competence, reli-\\nability and transparency.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each social issue related to sus-\\ntainability as part of the materiality analysis. The risks arising \\nfrom social issues, their impact and the implemented meas-\\nures are described in greater detail in section 5. \\n\\nChallenges from COVID–19\\nA taskforce comprising the Management Board, members of \\nthe Executive Committee and internal experts was established \\nin March 2020 in reaction to the outbreak of the COVID-19 \\npandemic.  It  is  responsible  for  defining  the  necessary  dis-\\ntancing and hygiene measures in the company and at con-\\nstruction sites to create the safest possible working conditions \\nunder the given situation in the countries with UBM locations \\nand projects. Protecting the health and safety of all employees \\nis this team’s overriding goal. \\n\\nThe  results  of  this  fast  reaction: The  active  communication \\nof measures to employees and testing offers at UBM’s loca-\\ntions and construction sites minimised the effects on UBM. \\nAdditional information on the risks related to the COVID-19 \\npandemic can be found in the 2021 annual report beginning \\non page 122.\\n\\n59\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0cIn the area of social issues, the materiality analysis identified the following risks: \\n\\nSustainability issues\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nMeasures\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n\\nAttractive employer & training  \\nand education\\n\\nDiversity and equal opportunities\\n\\n \\x1f Higher turnover and the related  \\nadditional costs, increasing costs  \\nfor new hiring\\n\\n \\x1f Decline in innovation power and  \\n\\nproductivity\\n\\n \\x1f Image loss\\n\\n \\x1f Loss of innovation potential when per-\\nsonal backgrounds are not considered\\n \\x1f Lack of motivation, higher turnover and \\n\\nthe resulting higher costs\\n\\n \\x1f Increasing legal requirements \\n \\x1f Image loss\\n\\n \\x1f Active support for an open communica-\\n\\ntion culture and work-life balance\\n\\n \\x1f Measures to develop skills and career \\nplanning, opportunities for personal \\ndevelopment\\n\\n \\x1f Competitive and performance-oriented \\n\\nremuneration and benefits\\n\\n \\x1f Targeted recruiting of suitable  \\n\\nfemale candidates\\n\\n \\x1f Exchange of experience  \\n\\n(“buddy principle“)\\n\\nOccupational health and safety\\n\\n \\x1f Rising costs due to lost workdays and \\n\\n \\x1f Integrated management system for  \\n\\nillness\\n\\n \\x1f Image loss\\n\\nSOCIETY\\n\\nArchitecture, urban quarter development \\nand social diversity\\n\\n \\x1f Increasing requirements for barrier-free, \\n\\nflexible and smart housing due to  \\ndemographic shift\\n\\noccupational safety and health  \\nprotection \\n\\n \\x1f Active support for physical and  \\n\\npsychological health\\n\\n \\x1f Green building certification \\n \\x1f Active support for stakeholder  \\n\\ndialogues\\n\\n \\x1f Membership in initiatives like  \\n\\nÖGNI, ICG\\n\\nMobility and infrastructure\\n\\n \\x1f Standing assets become more difficult \\n\\n \\x1f Flagship projects for future-oriented \\n\\nor impossible to sell\\n\\nCustomer orientation and  \\ncreating awareness\\n\\n \\x1f Project delays\\n \\x1f Market entry problems\\n\\nmobility concepts\\n\\n \\x1f Active support for stakeholder  \\n\\ndialogues\\n\\n \\x1f Green building certification \\n \\x1f Active support for stakeholder  \\n\\ndialogues\\n\\n \\x1f Membership in initiatives like  \\n\\nÖGNI, ICG\\n\\n60\\n\\n61\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c3.6.3.

ESG reporting\\n\\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-\\ntrian  Sustainability  and  Diversity  Improvement Act  but  has \\nvoluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in \\nline with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, \\nthe company is very well prepared to address the information \\nrequirements  at  the  product  and  corporate  levels  that  will \\nresult from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. \\n\\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing \\nregulatory developments – for example, the materiality analy-\\nsis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-\\nover, UBM’s reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and \\nnorms  like  the  UN  Global  Compact  (see  section  3.9.). This \\nESG  report  serves  as  a  progress  report  for  the  UN  Global \\nCompact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD \\nrecommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this \\nreport for the first time (see section 3.6.).\\n\\nIn  connection  with  the  concrete,  measurable  goals  for  the \\ncoming  years  which  were  set  in  2021,  the  ESG  report  is  a \\nvaluable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-\\nity  to  society.  The  ESG  report  describes  the  management \\napproaches, goals and measures related to the environment, \\nsociety and governance, and highlights successes as well as \\nchallenges. The  subject  areas  are  based  on  the  materiality \\nanalysis carried out in 2021. The ESG report is prepared by \\nthe investor relations & ESG department in coordination with \\nthe specialist departments and released by the Management \\nBoard. Additional  information  on  UBM,  its  business  devel-\\nopment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 \\nannual report.\\n\\nTransparency  and  reliability  are  also  decisive  for  our  ESG \\nreporting,  and  we  therefore  arranged  for  an  external  lim-\\nited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is \\nprovided on page 125). UBM also introduced a central data \\nmanagement  tool  in  2021  which  will  be  successively  filled \\nstarting  in  2022. The  goal  is  to  create  an  informative  basis \\nfor the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. \\nControlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while \\ndata  collection  takes  place  directly  in  the  respective  areas \\nand departments in the individual countries.

That makes UBM Development one \\nof the most sustainable companies in its sector in Germany \\nand Austria.\\n\\nThe corporate rating by ISS ESG evaluates the ecological and \\nsocial performance of a company based on more than 100 \\nselected sector-specific ecological, social and corporate gov-\\nernance criteria.\\n\\n62\\n\\n63\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0cand sector associations. The company has been a member \\nof the Institute for Corporate Governance (ICG) since 2019 \\nand contributes to the ICG’s social impact investment initia-\\ntive. In addition, UBM is a member of the corporate platform \\nrespACT  (Austrian  Council  for  Sustainable  Development), \\nthe Austrian Sustainable Building Council (“Österreichische \\nGesellschaft  für  Nachhaltige  Immobilienwirtschaft”,  ÖGNI) \\nand Hotel Management Associates (HAMA).\\n\\nUBM expanded its active participation in the interest group \\n“IG-Lebenszyklus Bau” to include membership in 2020. The \\norganisation’s  working  group  on  the  shortage  of  land  is \\nheaded, among others, by Gerald Beck, managing director \\nof UBM Austria. We are committed to finding ways to stop the \\nwasteful use of the limited resource land with existing and \\nnew framework conditions.\\n\\nWe  also  play  an  active  role  in  the  Association  of  Austrian \\nProject Developers (“Vereinigung der Österreichischen Pro-\\njektentwickler“, VÖPE). Together with other VÖPE members, \\nUBM shows that project developers can be strong and reli-\\nable partners for the general public and the public sector in \\nthe creation of living environments.    GRI 2-28\\n\\nEcoVadis: Gold for UBM Development\\nThe first evaluation by the internationally recognised ESG rat-\\ning agency EcoVadis led to Gold for UBM Development AG. \\nUBM now belongs to the top two per cent of the sector (real \\nestate and housing) and the top five per cent of the 75,000 \\ncompanies graded by EcoVadis.\\n\\nThis  evaluation  is  based  on  21  criteria  from  the  four  most \\nimportant  sustainability  aspects:  environment,  labour  and \\nhuman rights, ethics and sustainable reporting. UBM’s per-\\nformance exceeded the sector average in all four categories.\\n\\n3.9.

UBM  has \\noffice space at 19 locations. Our goal in this area is to steadily \\nreduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach \\nthis goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-\\ntion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-\\nagement are also important issues for UBM and are internally \\nmanaged and reported. \\n\\nFewer standing assets\\nThe  strategic  focus  of  UBM’s  business  activities  includes \\nthe  development  and  sale  of  properties.  Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties – here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\n67\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT \\n \\n\\x0c4.1.

The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent \\nby  2050.  Related  activities  include  the  European  Commis-\\nsion‘s “Fit for 55“ package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n– including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers – are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole – reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI  3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials,  energy-efficient  building  design,  and  the  use  of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction  is  responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction  and  operation  of  a  building  can  be  reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop “smart“ buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360° principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the “Next Level“ efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics – as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360° process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable  –  and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset  a  goal  as  part  of  its  strategic  reorientation  to  achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class – at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.  Our  business  partners \\nare required to meet the same high standards, for example \\nstrict environmental requirements for suppliers’ production \\nprocesses and building material components. Environmental \\nprotection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement \\n(further information can be found in section 6).\\n\\nThe focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations \\nis  also  increasing.  The  corporate  units  in  Austria  (AG  and \\nUBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified \\nunder  the  international  environmental  management  norm  \\nISO  14001  and  quality  management  norm  ISO  9001,  and \\nUBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022.

Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for \\nbuilding shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-\\nnical  equipment. The  use  of  timber  as  a  building  material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. An \\nactive commitment to sustainability best practices makes it \\npossible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to opti-\\nmise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 \\nemissions.\\n\\nopment  AG  and  UBM  Austria  are  also  certified  under  the  \\nISO 50001 energy management norm. Our binding ethics \\ncode,  in  which  the  subject  of  environmental  protection  is \\nanchored, creates the foundation for all business activities \\nand decisions, whereby compliance is confirmed in writing \\nby our employees (see section 6 for further information).\\n\\nThe United Nations recommends three steps to achieve cli-\\nmate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, \\nfinally,  compensate  for  unavoidable  emissions.  We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin  2022. This  non-profit  foundation  includes  partners  from \\nindustry  and  science  who  work  together  to  develop  tech-\\nnical applications for smart buildings. The foundation com-\\nplements our green. smart. and more. strategy and will con-\\ntribute to achieving greater sustainability in the real estate \\nsector. Its goals include the long-term reduction of emissions \\nand resource consumption as well as the optimisation of eco-\\nnomic feasibility for sustainable office and residential con-\\ncepts.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360° principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM  underscored  its  commitment  to  sustainable  building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe  positive  experience  from  this Vienna  project  was  also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction.  This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the “embodied carbon”, \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics \\non  the  timber  market  were  a  further  source  of  uncertainty \\nduring the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber \\nprice stabilised at a level where this raw material is available \\nat a reasonable price. \\n\\nEnergy & CO2 intensity\\n \\x1f Reduction of primary energy requirements to national \\n\\nnearly zero energy building standards by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\\n \\x1f Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy \\n\\ncarriers to 50% by 2030\\n\\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined \\nthe primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-\\nning of technical building equipment in all new development \\nprojects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-\\ntems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-\\ntion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or \\nequipment.\\n\\nThe durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-\\nond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: \\nThe specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life \\nCycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle \\nAssessments  (LCA/lifecycle  evaluations).  These  planning \\ntools make it possible to determine and, where necessary, \\nto optimise the energy requirements and CO2 emissions of \\nbuildings from construction to maintenance and dismantling.\\n\\n70\\n\\n71\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cThe calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is based on the final energy requirements in the respective project. \\nThe energy intensity depends on the project specifics (asset class, countries) and is therefore subject to fluctuations.\\n\\nEnergy indicators – real estate development \\n\\nTotal calculated energy consumption [kWh]\\n\\nGFA of development projects [m²]\\n\\nCalculated energy intensity [kWh/m²]\\n\\nDirect/Indirect GHG emissions [t]1\\n\\nIntensity of GHG emissions [kg/m²]1\\n\\nProperty area in total [m²]\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\n11,165,679\\n\\n118,104\\n\\n95\\n\\n3,132\\n\\n27\\n\\n45,678\\n\\n9,515,538\\n\\n129,269\\n\\n74\\n\\n2,460\\n\\n19\\n\\n47,783\\n\\n7,243,201\\n\\n70,431\\n\\n103\\n\\n1,920\\n\\n27\\n\\n25,884\\n\\n1   Information on the emission factors used can be found in chapter 7. The energy consumption in the project development is calculated as per certificates.\\n\\nGreen building certification\\n \\x1f Obtain green building certification for 100% of new \\n\\ndevelopments starting in 2022\\n\\nUBM expanded its sustainability strategy in 2021 to include \\ninternationally recognised certification for the residential con-\\nstruction projects that are designated for global sale. Green \\nbuilding  certification  for  all  new  projects  is  a  mandatory \\nelement of the 360° principle. In addition, the profiles “dis- \\nmantling“ and “construction site“ were added to the certifica-\\ntion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project \\nin  Vienna.  UBM  has  decided  to  extend  its  certifications  to \\nrefurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call \\nfor the continuation of this strategy. The following projects \\nwere successfully completed in 2021:\\n\\n \\x1f anders wohnen, Munich-Pasing \\n \\x1f barany.7, Vienna\\n \\x1f Pohlgasse, Vienna\\n \\x1f Neugraf, Prague\\n \\x1f Astrid Office, Prague\\n \\x1f voco, The Hague\\n \\x1f Mercure, Katowice\\n \\x1f Holiday Inn Express, Düsseldorf\\n \\x1f ibis Styles, Krakow\\n \\x1f Am Kanal, Potsdam\\n\\nThe  residential  and  hotel  asset  classes  comprised  a  major \\npart of the projects finalised by UBM in 2021. Four projects \\nin each of these two classes, with 47,072 m² (residential) and \\n51,149 m² (hotels) of GFA were completed, each represent-\\ning 40% of the total completions.  \\n\\nSix of the ten projects completed in 2021, representing 100% \\nof the commercial properties, successfully completed a sus-\\ntainability assessment. In total, 71,032 m² of the 118,104\\xa0m² \\nGFA  completed  in  that  year,  or  60%,  were  certified.  The \\nfour uncertified projects are residential projects which were \\nstarted before UBM’s strategic reorientation, and certification \\nwas therefore not carried out.\\n\\nUBM plans to continue building certification as confirmation \\nof the sustainability of its property developments. All projects \\nin all asset classes in the pipeline will undergo a sustainabil-\\nity assessment in the future to support the attainment of the \\ndefined goals over the long term. Building certification will \\nalso be used as a tool to implement the requirements of the \\nEU Taxonomy in established systems.\\n\\n71\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cThe following table shows the classification of certified and uncertified projects:\\n\\nCertifications – real estate development \\n\\nProjects – all asset classes [number]\\n\\nOffice [number]\\n\\nHotel [number]\\n\\nResidential [number]\\n\\nOther and Mix [number]\\n\\nGFA total [m²]\\n\\nGFA certified [%]\\n\\nGFA certified [m²]\\n\\nGFA not certified [m²]\\n\\nCertifications1 [number]\\n\\nDGNB [number]\\n\\nLEED [number]\\n\\nBREEAM [number]\\n\\n2021\\n\\n10\\n\\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n1\\n\\n118,104\\n\\n60\\n\\n71,032\\n\\n47,072\\n\\n6\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n2020\\n\\n10\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n7\\n\\n0\\n\\n129,269\\n\\n41\\n\\n52,453\\n\\n76,816\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n8\\n\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n70,431\\n\\n55\\n\\n39,010\\n\\n31,420\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n0\\n\\n1   The data are based on the absolute number of projects, without an adjustment for double certification.\\n\\nCorporate locations\\nGoals from our sustainability programme:\\n\\nIncrease in  \\nrenewable energy\\n\\nVehicles with  \\nalternative drives\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nRenewable energy & energy management\\n \\x1f Increase the share of renewable energy in energy  \\n\\ncarriers to 30% by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Establish/optimise building management systems \\n\\n(BMS) at all UBM locations by 2025 \\n\\n72\\n\\n73\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cbeen ongoing since 2021 to extend these procedures to the \\nother locations.  \\n\\nVehicles\\n \\x1f Double the number of vehicles with alternative drives \\n\\nby 2025 (basis 2021)\\n\\nRecords have been kept on the petrol and diesel consump-\\ntion of all Group motor vehicles since 2020. These surveys \\nprovide  the  basis  for  defining  concrete  targets  to  reduce \\nemissions. Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles \\nwhen new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also \\ninvolves the availability of suitable charging stations near the \\nemployee‘s home. In 2021, UBM’s motor vehicle pool had 18 \\nvehicles with alternative drives.\\n\\nTravel\\n \\x1f Reduce CO2 in air travel by 25% (basis 2019) by 2025\\n\\nThe  Group-wide  travel  guideline  “think  before  you  travel” \\nmakes clear that business trips should only be taken when \\nabsolutely  necessary.  Rail  travel  must  be  given  preference \\nfor shorter distances, and video conference portals should be \\nused more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group’s commu-\\nnity “live”. This event was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith  a  long  list  of  requirements  including  environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM’s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group’s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM  has  carried  out  regular  energy  audits  since  2016  in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001. ISO 50001 audits are scheduled for \\nGermany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will \\nfollow.\\n\\nAn important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will \\nbe expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more \\nexact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-\\nsions. This will support the development of further climate \\nprotection initiatives in the future. Transparent data collection \\nis already in place at most of the locations, and projects have \\n\\n73\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cStanding assets\\nGoal from our sustainability programme:\\n\\n4.2.

The W3, a stand-\\ning asset in Vienna, already purchases green electricity and, \\nin addition to district heating, is also changing over to district \\ncooling. A “manage to green“ project is currently in progress \\nat the Poleczki Business Park in Poland. It involves the neutral-\\nisation of CO2 emissions  from the total electricity consump-\\ntion  in  2021  and  2022  through  certificates  because  green \\nelectricity is not available at that location. In order to ensure \\nthe long-term availability of renewable energy, photovoltaic \\nequipment is currently being installed on the rooftop of one \\nof the office buildings in the commercial park.\\n\\nEnergy management & CO2 intensity\\n \\x1f Reduce CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2020) by 2030\\n \\x1f Establish/Optimise building management systems at all \\n\\nstanding assets by 2022 \\n\\n \\x1f Anchor guideline for sustainable building operations in \\n\\nall standing assets by 2022\\n\\nUBM is equipping or refitting all standing assets with build-\\ning  management  systems  to  support  energy  optimisation. \\nCO2 intensity will be reduced by refitting with highly efficient \\nenergy systems and building automation. In addition, a guide-\\nline for sustainable building operations will be prepared for \\nall tenants.   GRI  3-3\\n\\nIn property development, the early planning phase defines \\nthe scope of the ecological footprint – and can be seen as \\nthe key to an efficient circular economy. Our focus on struc-\\ntural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their \\ndurability and their recycling capability.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  anchors,  among  others,  the  transition \\nto a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-\\nstruction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits  through  prefabrication  and  modular  construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe  production  of  steel  and  concrete,  in  particular,  is  CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.  Later  recycling  capacity  can  be \\nactively included as early as the planning stage, for example \\n\\n74\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cWork has also started to optimise CO2 emissions  over the \\nentire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping \\nwith the focus on sustainability.  GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n4.3.  Ground sealing, climate change  \\nadjustments and biodiversity \\n\\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the \\nlocal fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate – local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands) – and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM’s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough  the  avoidance  of  inseparable  composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled – untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n \\x1f Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n \\x1f Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe  planning  stage  for  all  UBM  projects  must  include  and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall,  for  building  sections  with  massive  components  as  well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare  separated  mechanically  at  the  site,  and  high  priority  is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall  materials  resulting  from  demolition  can  be  reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded “Gold“ \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0cUBM’s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource “land”, \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern. It will be reflected in future projects through roof-\\ntops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and \\nfacade greening – which will help to reduce the heat island \\neffect in our urban areas as well as the heating and cooling \\nload.\\n\\nUBM’s focal points for biodiversity are as follows:\\n\\n \\x1f Brownfield developments\\n \\x1f Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities\\n \\x1f Increase in biological diversity through roof and  \\n\\nfacade greening \\n\\n \\x1f Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening\\n\\nGoal from our sustainability programme:\\n\\nBrownfield  \\ndevelopment\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nBrownfield development\\n \\x1f Increase share of brownfield developments  \\n\\nin new projects to over 66% by 2025\\n\\nAs mentioned above, UBM’s acquisition process is focused \\non brownfield developments (land with existing buildings). \\nBiodiversity has been integrated in UBM‘s 360° process land-\\nscape. The relevant parameters (tree stock, groundwater, con-\\ntamination,  previous  use,  etc.)  for  all  asset  classes  are  sur-\\nveyed and monitored in accordance with the “Land“ checklist. \\n\\nOur reporting on development projects is based solely on the \\nsealed areas, with a differentiation between greenfield and \\nbrownfield. Greenfield developments represent roughly 24% \\nof the 45,678 m² in the ten projects completed during 2021. \\nWe also exchanged an area of 24,290 m² on four brownfield \\nprojects.

Stricter  legal  requirements \\nfor  building  demolition  can  be  expected  in  the  future,  for \\nexample through the consequent separation of construction \\nand demolition waste or the production of quality-assured \\nsecondary building materials.\\n\\nRefurbishment  projects  are  a  fixed  and  steadily  increasing \\ncomponent of UBM’s real estate development portfolio. In \\ncomparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-\\ntion,  the  conversion  and  vitalisation  of  existing  buildings \\nresults  in  lower  energy  consumption  and  lower  CO2  emis-\\nsions – an important ecological aspect that will also be taken \\ninto account in the future. Other resource-conserving benefits \\ninclude the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new \\nsoil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and \\n\\nthe preservation of existing building substance. The lifecycle \\nof a building is extended as a result, and that reduces CO2 \\nemissions.\\n\\nUBM has increased its focus on projects involving revitalisa-\\ntion and has also set a goal to evaluate all refurbishment pro-\\njects based on sustainability criteria.

The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.

Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith  the Austrian  Ecolabel  criteria,  specific  measures  were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure  Katowice  Centrum:  Its  18-metre-high  and  260  m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the “green and clean“ motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c80\\n\\n81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

Attractive employer &  \\ntraining and education \\n\\nThis also includes fair and responsible interaction with our \\nemployees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and \\nmen who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-\\nterm success and essential for the positive development of \\nour company. In this connection, we have defined the follow-\\ning focus areas:\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer and training & education \\n \\x1f Diversity and equal opportunities\\n \\x1f Health and occupational safety\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local \\ncommunities  and  neighbouring  residents.  Our  projects \\ncontribute  to  the  quality  of  life  for  society. This  applies,  in \\nparticular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true \\nfor residential construction and office buildings. We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n \\x1f Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n \\x1f Infrastructure & mobility\\n \\x1f Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company’s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study “The State of Skills 2021“ shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems  at  several  levels  over  the  long  term.  Employees \\nwith  insufficient  expertise  will  be  unable  to  carry  out  their \\nactivities at a higher quality level – and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments  take  longer,  and  both  quality  and  motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0cfor the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nauthorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. \\nWe encourage our employees to be proactive through short \\ndecision paths and flat hierarchies.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities  can  lead  to  lower  employee  motivation  and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust  respect  human  rights,  reject  child  labour  and  forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive  working  conditions  can  damage  a  company’s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers  in  online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company’s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM’s success. UBM supports its \\nemployees in reaching their personal career goals and offers \\nthem opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and \\ndevelopment possibilities and numerous benefits.\\n\\nWith our values – competent. consequent. transparent. – we \\ncreate a working climate in which each person feels included, \\n\\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict com-\\npliance with the national and international rules and require-\\nments in the markets where we are active. We also base our \\nactions  on  agreements  that  include  the  Universal  Declara-\\ntion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the \\ninternational labour standards set by the International Labour \\nOrganisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas  well  as  a  green  inner  courtyard  and  roof  terrace  with  a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created “new work zones“ serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur  Group-wide  UBM  Day,  which  is  held  every  two  years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders. In addi-\\ntion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise \\nevents like barista workshops and joint participation in sport \\nevents to promote teambuilding.\\n\\nWork-life balance\\nWe believe it is important to help our employees establish \\na healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and \\nfamily  life.  Individual  working  time  models  are  part  of  our \\nefforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the \\ncompany agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family \\nmembers. Employees have access to special time off under \\ncertain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-\\ntled to parental leave.\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0cOpen communications are a central \\nelement of our corporate values and  \\nan important building block for our \\nattractiveness as an employer.\\n\\nPerformance-based remuneration\\nWith very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that \\nare tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM \\nemployees participate in the company’s success.\\n\\nBenefits\\nAdditional benefits include, among  others, the  reimburse-\\nment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-\\nsidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-\\nance.  Special  projects  to  help  employees  remain  healthy \\ninclude  in-house  fitness  programmes  and  a  subsidy  for \\nannual membership in a fitness studio. An important part of \\nthis policy specifies that these benefits are also available to \\npart-time employees. In this respect, UBM does not differen-\\ntiate between full-time and part-time employees.\\n\\nCareer, training and continuing education  \\nSpecially  planned  training  and  continuing  education  pro-\\ngrammes are a fixed part of human resources development \\nat UBM. The basis is formed by the annual appraisal meet-\\ning,  which  includes  an  agreement  on  goals  and  specific \\ntraining measures together with the responsible supervisor. \\nUBM  actively  offers  numerous  educational  opportunities \\nranging  from  internal  workshops  and  idea  competitions \\nto external training programmes, but also encourages and \\nsupports  the  independent  development  of  its  employees.  \\n\\nGRI  2-23, 2-25, 3-3, 401-2, 404-2\\n\\nWe actively offer numerous devel-\\nopment opportunities as part of our \\nhuman resources strategy, but also \\nencourage employees’ independent \\ndevelopment.\\n\\n5.1.3.

Diversity and equal opportunities\\n\\nA working environment free of discrimination and a culture \\nof  mutual  respect  and  appreciation  throughout  the  entire \\nworkforce – these are the requirements for equal opportu-\\nnities and diversity in a company. A company that does not \\npromote diversity and equal opportunities risks damage to \\nits reputation and, in the worst case, could be faced with legal \\nconsequences.\\n\\nPoor performance in this area can undermine a company’s \\nposition on the market and result in the loss of business part-\\nners and customers. Innovation potential is also lost when the \\npersonal  backgrounds  of  employees  (e.g.  migration  back-\\nground, nationality, family constellations) are ignored. \\n\\nThe lack of equal opportunities at the workplace (remunera-\\ntion etc.) can lead to lower employee motivation and higher \\nturnover, which means additional costs and time for new hir-\\ning.  Moreover,  there  are  signs  that  the  legal  requirements \\ngoverning equal opportunities will be strengthened in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nFair  treatment  of  our  employees  and  a  culture  of  mutual \\nrespect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all \\nemployees equally – regardless of their ethnic, national or \\nsocial background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or \\nreligious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic \\nor other standing.

The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe  success  of  these  measures  is  reflected  in  the  number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees’ health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms. Outdoor athletes can join the “UBM-Express” and \\ntake part in various running events. An occupational physi-\\ncian is also available to assist employees at UBM’s Vienna \\nlocation.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today’s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur  many  years  of  experience  as  a  real  estate  developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus,  that  means  designing  projects  to  minimise  the  poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and ÖGNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Accessibility\\n \\x1f Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n \\x1f Indoor climate and acoustics\\n \\x1f Security \\n \\x1f Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification  –  through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends – as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.   GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n88\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c5.5. Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept – for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas  well  as  sustainable  mobility  concepts  (car/bike  sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality  of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation. The following offering is \\ndesigned to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-\\ntally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-\\ning users:\\n\\n \\x1f E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for \\n\\ne-bike batteries \\n\\n \\x1f Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle\\n \\x1f E-bike hire stations\\n \\x1f Additional bicycle storage areas\\n \\x1f Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers \\nand changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair \\npoint \\n\\nSome  of  these  services,  for  example  car  sharing  and  the \\ne-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in \\nthe neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower – which creates excellent and \\nefficient synergies for both buildings.\\n\\nAt the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be \\nable to use e-charging stations in the office and residential \\nareas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing \\nproducts.   \\n\\nThe Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, \\nis  currently  carrying  out  a  “manage  to  green“  project  that \\ninvolves  the  refitting  of  two  buildings  to  include  parking \\nspaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, \\ne-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking \\nspaces in the business park.   GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n5.6.  Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness  of  sustainability  issues  can  also  improve  users’  sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM  wants  to  create  attractive  quarters  that  contribute  to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0cThe  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM’s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens‘ initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nHöfe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject  –  and  for  all  other  UBM  developments  –  is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city’s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens’ concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone – an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n– is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill  generate  energy  on  site  with  wells  and  depth  probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject.  In  addition  to  shared  spaces,  shared  mobility  and \\nshared  activities,  the  use  of  a  quarter  management  app  is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases  and  improves  the  value  of  the  area  surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation  of  its  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.  Construction  is \\nscheduled to start in 2023.    GRI  2-23, 2-25\\n\\n90\\n\\n91\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c91\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c92\\n\\n93\\n\\n50UBM & GOVERNANCE92\\x0c93\\n\\n51UBM & GOVERNANCE6.

For UBM, good governance means \\nbeing  viewed  as  a  trustworthy  and  reliable  partner  by  our \\nstakeholders. That is the foundation of our business success.\\n\\nUBM’s  values  –  competent.  consequent.  transparent.  –  are \\nreflected  in  our  social  responsibility:  act  ethically,  accept \\nthe  consequences,  communicate  transparently.  To  ensure \\nthat our values are lived throughout the entire company and \\nreflected in our employees‘ everyday activities, our actions \\nare based on ethical principles, relevant national and inter-\\nnational legal norms, and internal guidelines. \\n\\nAs an active part of society, we accept our responsibility and \\nhave identified the following material subject areas as part \\nof our materiality analysis:\\n\\n \\x1f Corporate governance & compliance\\n \\x1f Sustainable procurement & regional added value\\n \\x1f Innovation & technologies\\n\\n6.1. Corporate governance & compliance \\n\\n6.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial  benefits and can help to improve the quality of  life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand,  on  the  other  hand,  criminal  prosecution  is  becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties  and  civil  claims  by  damaged  parties.  In  many  cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany’s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years – also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard (“Sustainable Corporate Governance“) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n94\\n\\n95\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c6.1.2. Our commitment  \\nResponsible  actions  start  at  an  individual  level  but,  as  a \\ncompany,  we  have  a  duty  and  responsibility  to  create  the \\nnecessary framework. UBM does this, for example, through \\ntransparent internal directives and a code of conduct, com-\\nmitment to various corporate governance guidelines and the \\nUN  Global  Compact,  and  an  effective  internal  compliance \\nmanagement system.\\n\\nResponsible and transparent management has top priority \\nfor UBM. Compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, \\nguidelines, standards and norms in the countries where UBM \\nis active goes without saying. The high demands we set for \\nourselves also apply to our business partners and employees. \\nUBM’s business model is oriented on ecological, social and \\nethically  correct  business  practices.  In  order  to  strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural \\nrequirements.\\n\\nUBM’s  focus  markets  are  strictly  regulated  and  controlled \\nlegal areas with high human rights standards. Nonetheless, \\nviolations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and \\nrespect  for  human  rights  is  therefore  anchored  in  internal \\nguidelines. We are committed to the ten principles of the UN \\nGlobal  Compact  which,  for  example,  prohibit  child  labour \\nand  forced  labour.  Our  codes  of  conduct  (ethic  code  and \\ncode of conduct for business partners) require guarantees \\nfor  fair  compensation,  workplace  safety,  support  for  equal \\nopportunity and the freedom of association, for example.\\n\\nOur responsible and transparent management is based on \\nthe following cornerstones:\\n\\nAustrian Code of Corporate Governance\\nUBM,  as  an  international  listed  company,  has  pledged  its \\ncommitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a \\nvoluntary guideline for good management and control. The \\ncompany has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-\\nnal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions.\\n\\nCompliance Management System\\nThe compliance management system implemented by UBM \\nis intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal \\nregulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-\\ntions. A compliance management system manual details the \\nresponsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation \\nas well as the processes which implement the related rules \\nand  guidelines.  The  Management  Board  and  Supervisory \\nBoard consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-\\nsequent  implementation  of  all  compliance  principles.  Our \\napproach follows the principle of prevention – disclosure – \\nreaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect \\nbehaviour.\\n\\nThe  trust  of  employees,  business  partners,  customers  and \\nother stakeholders is strengthened by UBM’s focus on trans-\\nparency,  anti-corruption,  fair  business  practices,  the  pre-\\nvention of money laundering and data protection. Internal \\nguidelines and work instructions form the framework for the \\nnecessary procedures – examples are:\\n\\nConsequent compliance with applicable national and inter-\\nnational  legal  norms  as  well  as  our  ethical  principles  safe-\\nguards the trust of our stakeholders. We are non-partisan and \\ndo not make any donations to political parties.\\n\\nGuideline: Cartel and Competition Law  \\nAgreements and coordinated actions with third-party com-\\npanies  that  lead  to  –  or  aim  to  lead  to  –  the  restriction  of \\ncompetition are prohibited and will not be tolerated by UBM. \\n\\nGuideline: Anti-corruption \\nUBM  employees  are  prohibited,  without  exception,  from \\naccepting  or  granting  monetary  gifts.

Reports can be submitted directly to \\na staff member in the compliance organisation or sent by email to  \\ncompliance@ubm-development.com or anonymously via the \\nlink https://secureveal.ubm-development.com. The reporting \\nof  potential  violations  is  in  the  interest  of  the  Management \\nBoard as well as the management of the Group companies. In \\n\\nData protection\\nUBM is committed to the confidential and responsible handling  \\nof personal data in agreement with the applicable data pro-\\ntection laws – above all the EU Data Protection Regulation and \\nrelated national legislation. Secure handling is guaranteed \\nby a data protection manual that includes rules for internal \\ndata  processing,  work  procedures  and  their  monitoring.  \\nRegular  employee  training  and  surveys  create  a  greater \\nawareness of this sensitive issue and make sure data protec-\\ntion does not drift out of focus.\\n\\nEthics code\\nA separate, binding ethics code forms the basis for all busi-\\nness activities and decisions. It is the foundation for moral, \\nethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-\\nees and is designed to prevent mistakes.\\n\\nThe values and principles contained in the code are based \\non national and international laws and requirements and on \\nagreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\nthe  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  the  United \\nNations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-\\nness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-\\ntional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set \\nby  the  International  Labour  Organisation  (in  particular  the \\nFundamental Principles of the IAO). \\n\\nThe subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among \\nothers, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-\\ntal  and  human  rights,  working  conditions,  occupational \\nsafety and health, environmental protection, the prevention \\nof  money  laundering,  and  data  protection.  This  code  has \\nbeen expressly agreed in writing with all employees in their \\n\\n96\\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0cnational  language  since  2021  and  is  regularly  adapted  to \\nreflect developments in the social and regulatory environ-\\nment as well as ethic values. The last update was completed \\nin December 2021.\\n\\nFurther information on the ethics code can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item “ESG“. \\n\\nCode of conduct for business partners\\nWe not only place high priority on responsible actions by all \\nUBM  employees,  but  also  set  high  standards  for  our  busi-\\nness partners. A separate code of conduct for our business \\npartners is firmly anchored in our corporate processes and \\nregularly  adapted  to  reflect  developments  in  the  business \\nand  regulatory  environment  and  in  fundamental  ethic  val-\\nues. The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and \\nincluded requirements for all business partners to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain.\\n\\nThis code is based on the same principles and regulations as \\nthe ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, \\nfair  competition,  fundamental  and  human  rights,  working \\nconditions,  occupational  safety  and  health,  environmental \\nprotection,  the  prevention  of  money  laundering,  and  data \\nprotection. The code of conduct applies to all business part-\\nners who sell their products or services to UBM. If a business \\npartner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated \\ncontracts  will  not  be  signed  and  the  compliance  officer  is \\nimmediately informed. He will then decide – together with the \\nManagement Board – on further procedures. In the event the \\ncode is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable \\nmeasures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-\\nsion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with \\nthe business partner. \\n\\nFurther information on the code of conduct for business part-\\nners can be found on our website under the menu item “ESG“.\\n\\nWorks Council  \\nUBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected \\nevery four years. Four of these members are delegated to \\nthe Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the \\nvotes.\\n\\nUBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the \\nrespective national frameworks as well as representation on \\nthe Supervisory Board. The Works Council also takes part in \\ncollective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with \\nUBM’s  approval.  The  newly  founded  ESG  Committee  also \\nincludes one member from the Works Council.\\n\\nDuring the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or \\nviolations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBM‘s oper-\\nating locations or suppliers.\\n\\nTransparent processes \\nUBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which \\ngo beyond legal requirements. These processes are opera-\\ntionally standardised through an institutionalised 360° prin-\\nciple. More specifically: As part of the “Next Level“ efficiency \\nprogramme, all core and support processes for project devel-\\nopment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates \\nand  ultimately  defined  for  the  entire  company.  Roles  and \\nresponsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and \\nthe control mechanisms were revised and improved. These \\nprocedures  and  rules  give  employees  the  corresponding \\ntools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design \\nof processes and controls. \\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0cWe  are  convinced  that  these  types  of  work  instructions, \\nguidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-\\nmunication and documentation, and help to make processes \\nmore efficient. They also make effective controls possible.\\n\\nUBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-\\nance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and \\nto quickly identify and correct any weak points in business \\nand organisational processes, on the other hand.\\n\\n6.1.3. Organisational structure  \\nCompliance  management  at  UBM  is  installed  in  the  legal, \\ncorporate and compliance department, which is also respon-\\nsible for the content of the related guidelines. A compliance \\nofficer  and  deputy  were  appointed  by  the  Management \\nBoard of UBM AG. The compliance guidelines are prepared \\nby the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-\\nment Board and communicated to all employees. All UBM \\nemployees have digital access to these guidelines. \\n\\nThe internal control system and internal audit \\nOur  internal  control  system  (ICS)  is  an  integral  part  of  our \\nbusiness processes.

Both report \\ndirectly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling \\nmonitors the ongoing development of business to identify \\ndeviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes \\ncertain  management  receives  the  necessary  information. \\nTechnical  controlling  monitors  project  development  with \\na focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-\\ngress and all processes important for technical realisation.  \\nGRI  2-15, 2-23, 2-25, 2-26, 3-3, 205-2, 407-1\\n\\nThe compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines \\nand is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes \\nin legal regulations. The compliance guidelines are reviewed \\nannually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and \\ninternal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of \\nthe compliance management system. \\n\\nThe key positions in the internal data protection organisation \\nare the data protection coordinator and one data protection \\nofficer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-\\nment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-\\nlation of a data breach response team for the management \\nand reporting of data protection violations in agreement with \\nthe data protection guideline.\\n\\nA  money  laundering  officer  has  also  been  appointed.  As \\npart of KYC reviews (“know your customer“), he compares \\nthe data received with sanction lists, entries in the register \\nof economic owners, etc. Additional information on the KYC \\nreviews can be found on page 100.\\n\\nThe respective organisational units implement the individual \\ninternal guidelines and work instructions.

There were no proceedings \\nfor anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-\\nination incidents.  \\n\\nWhistleblower system\\nThe whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover \\nviolations  of  data  protection  regulations  and  other  report-\\nable incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. \\nIt will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports \\nin connection with UBM‘s ethics code and made available in \\nCzech and Polish.\\n\\nQuality management system\\nISO  9001  certification  is  intended  to  make  sure  the  pro-\\ncess-oriented quality management system is based on the \\nhighest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG \\nand UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-\\ntified  under  the  international  quality  management  norm  \\nISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-\\ntification covered 62% of UBM’s workforce in 2021.\\n\\nRemuneration model\\nThe possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model \\nwill be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in \\nmanagement‘s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\n\\nImplement guidelines and prevent misconduct by \\nconsequent preventive activities\\nEmployee training  \\nThe goal of training is to create a greater awareness among \\nemployees  for  potential  sources  of  risk  and,  in  this  way, \\nprevent  corruption  and  anti-competitive  behaviour.  New \\nemployees  receive  training  from  the  compliance  depart-\\nment  immediately  after  they  join  UBM.  Regular  e-learning \\nprogrammes cover compliance with guidelines on different \\nsubjects  like  the  anti-corruption  guideline  and  the  guide-\\nline on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to \\nensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, \\nand the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-\\npliance guideline to prevent market abuse.\\n\\nMost  of  the  classroom  training  on  compliance  regulations \\nhas been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 \\ndue  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. A  total  of  174  employee \\ntraining courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance \\nissues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money \\nlaundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were \\n\\n99\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0creworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case \\nexamples.  \\n\\nThe compliance team frequently visits training courses, and \\nthere are additional certifications for selected responsibilities \\n(for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified \\nas a compliance officer under ISO 19600).\\n\\nThe  procedure  for  the  distribution  of  relevant  corporate \\nguidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-\\nees  will  be  notified  separately  of  any  relevant  changes  in \\nexisting guidelines.\\n\\nEthics code\\nThe ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees \\nin their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet \\nour sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-\\ngration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, \\nthe focus on human rights and environmental protection was \\nreinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG \\nis also supported by company events and training (like the \\nClimate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the \\ngreen. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal \\ncommunication.\\n\\nSampling controls of insider information\\nThe compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-\\nitor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider \\ninformation and confidential and price-sensitive information. \\nAdditional clarification briefings are held if necessary.\\n\\nPrevent money laundering and terrorism financing\\nKYC review of new business partners\\nKnow your customer is one of the basic principles underly-\\ning the guideline for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing and the work instructions on money \\nlaundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries  and  contracts  with  politically  exposed  persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities. The related activities are classified \\ninternationally as having an increased risk of money launder-\\ning, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated \\nregularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing. \\n\\nThe  risk  analysis  for  all  Austrian  subsidiaries  which  have \\nregistered  brokerage  as  one  of  their  commercial  activities \\nwas updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the \\nrespective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement &  \\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream  supply  chain  (raw  materials  extraction,  materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM’s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays “Think global, order local“. Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM‘s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the  one hand, local  companies are  supported  and,  on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving  timber  construction.  UBM  created  jobs  and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM‘s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0cUBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-\\nscored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification \\nof  most  of  our  commercial  projects  –  including  residential \\nconstruction in the future – based on recognised sustainability \\nseals like DNGB, ÖGNI, LEED or BREEAM.\\n\\nThe green. smart. and more. initiative\\nIn  line  with  the  above-mentioned  management  approach, \\nthe green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. \\nIt is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that \\ncovered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The \\nfocus was placed on the following seven core issues which \\nwere defined in a dialogue between the Management Board \\nand Executive Committee:\\n\\nThese certifications also involve external experts and auditors \\nto confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. \\nMinimising the environmental impact of a building during its \\nentire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating \\nenergy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning \\nstage. The economic dimension covers the construction costs \\nas well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire \\nusage period or lifetime of the building.

Innovation & technologies  \\n\\nInternal and external research activities and innovations for \\nsustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value \\nchain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are \\nconsidered. The use of smart building technology (e.g. sen-\\nsors for smart ventilation, intelligent shading), for example, \\ncan make an important contribution to energy savings and \\nefficiency improvements and, in this way, reduce the negative \\nimpact  on  people  and  the  environment. An  urban  quarter \\nthat incorporates social aspects, e.g. communication areas, \\ninteractive commercial areas (co-working spaces, etc.) con-\\ntributes to the social structure and interaction in the quarter.\\n\\nsmart. is UBM’s keyword above all for new optimisation and \\ncontrol technologies as well as digitalisation. These activities \\nare focused on the following:\\n\\nIdeas and concepts were developed for these core areas as \\nanswers to the challenges created by climate change. The \\nprevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building \\nmaterials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-\\ngration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-\\nwords. The areas of Design & Construction, Energy and Build-\\ning  Operations,  in  particular,  offer  “green”  starting  points. \\nUBM responded with the following flagship projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Timber high-rise “Timber Pioneer” (Frankfurt)\\n \\x1f Quarter certification for the LeopoldQuartier (Vienna)\\n \\x1f barany.7 timber residential construction (Vienna)\\n \\x1f Green & Clean Hotel (Katowice)\\n\\nThe goals for green building certification were also reset. As \\nin the past, all new commercial buildings will be certified.\\n\\n102\\n\\n103\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0cDigitalisation of the UBM working world \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of the \\ncentral role played by digitalisation in keeping the economy, \\neducational  system  and  society  running  smoothly  during \\nthe lockdowns. UBM has made massive investments in the \\nGroup’s digitalisation in recent years and plans to continue \\nthese efforts in the future.\\n\\nUBM launched the “Next Level“ project in 2017 to digitally \\nmap operating and work processes as well as reporting and \\ncontrolling at corporate level. The “newBM“ project started in \\n2020 and is intended to move digitalisation at UBM a great \\nqualitative leap forward, especially in the commercial areas \\nbut also in IT and infrastructure.\\n\\nThe “newBM“ project included the development of an SAP \\nS/4 HANA system based on standard processes and SAP best \\npractices for 250 companies. A modern system supports the \\nfull digital management of HR processes, and a central treas-\\nury  system  safeguards  the  encrypted,  safe  and  integrated \\nhandling of payment flows throughout the Group. The IT con-\\nversion also includes the latest IT equipment and is focused \\non productivity, security and flexible working.

As early as the planning stage, UBM ensures that \\nbuildings are equipped for future “smartness“ trends – like \\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) or sensors – and can be adapted \\naccordingly.\\n\\nFuture-oriented mobility concepts will also play a role in quar-\\nter development projects through the interaction of e-mo-\\nbility, shared services and intelligent parking concepts. The \\nneeds of users and the local environment can therefore be \\nmet with the highest possible level of efficiency and resource \\nprotection.\\n\\nIn order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM cre-\\nated the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022. \\nThis non-profit foundation provides a platform for partners \\nfrom industry and science to develop technical application \\nsolutions  for  smart  buildings.

About this report \\n\\nThis report is UBM’s second ESG report and fifth sustainability \\nreport. It provides information on the 2021 financial year of \\nUBM Development AG.\\n\\nUBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which \\nwas based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards  “Core \\nOption“.\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with § 267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-\\nentation of information from previous reports is documented \\nin the footnotes beginning on page 112. The reported indi-\\ncators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019.\\n\\nThe management of UBM Development AG is responsible \\nfor preparation of the report content. An external review with \\nlimited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125). \\n\\nIf you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please \\nfeel  free  to  contact  UBM  at  esg@ubm-development.com.  \\nCurrent information on sustainability can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item “ESG“. \\n\\nGender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-\\nsible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no \\ndistinction was made between the genders. In the sense of \\n\\nequal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to \\nall genders.\\n\\nScope of consolidation  \\nThis report covers the corporate locations, standing assets \\nand development projects of UBM Development in Austria, \\nGermany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets. \\n\\nIn  the  hotel  business,  which  was  a  focal  point  of  activities \\nbefore  the  strategic  reorientation,  UBM  took  over  the  role \\nof  the  lessee  in  selected  cases  following  the  sale  of  the \\nrespective properties. The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled  under  UBM  hotels  Management  GmbH  in  2016,  and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment,  because  UBM  is  unable  to  control  the  related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe  indicators  in  the  section  on  the  environment  cover  all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and \\nimproved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based \\nprimarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database \\n(v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. \\n\\nWhere  actual  consumption  figures  are  not  available,  esti-\\nmates are used (mainly for project development, where the \\nenergy consumption is calculated as per certificates).\\n\\nDetails are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112.\\nGRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2\\n\\n106\\n\\n107\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c7.2.

These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-\\npendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a \\nlimited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.  \\n\\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract \\n(AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors (https://www.ksw.or.at/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-\\n209/), which also apply towards third parties. As provided under section 275 para. 2 UGB (liability provision regarding the \\naudit of financial statements of small and medium-sized companies), our responsibility and liability towards the Company \\nand any third parties arising from the assurance engagement are limited to a total of EUR 2 million. \\n\\n125\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0cThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a \\nreasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is sub-\\nstantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. \\n\\nThe selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following: \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the overall presentation of the disclosures and non-financial information\\n \\x1f Critical assessment of the Company’s analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders by inter-\\n\\nviewing the responsible employees and inspecting relevant documents \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including the due diligence processes implemented \\nas well as the processes used to ensure an accurate presentation in the ESG report by interviewing the Company’s \\nmanagement and inspecting internal guidelines, procedural instructions and management systems in connection with \\nnon-financial matters/disclosures \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an understanding of reporting processes by interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected docu-\\n\\nmentations \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indica-\\ntors, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations. All interviews as well as procedures \\nwere performed by virtual means due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the coronavirus containment measures\\n\\n \\x1f Examining the ESG report regarding its completeness in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of \\n\\nthe GRI Standards 2021\\n\\nThe following is not part of our engagement:\\n\\n \\x1f Examining the processes and internal controls particularly regarding their design, implementation and effectiveness \\n \\x1f Performing procedures at individual locations as well as measurements or individual evaluations to check the reliability \\n\\nand accuracy of data received \\n\\n \\x1f Examining the prior-year figures, forward-looking information or data from external surveys \\n \\x1f Examining the correct transfer of data and references from the (consolidated) financial statements to the non-financial \\n\\nreporting; and \\n\\n \\x1f Examining the information and disclosures on the website or further references on the internet\\n\\nNeither an audit nor a review of financial statements is objective of our engagement. Furthermore, neither the disclosure \\nand solution of criminal acts, as e.g. embezzlement or other kinds of fraud, and wrongful doings, nor the assessment of the \\neffectiveness and profitability of the management are the objectives of our engagement.\\n\\n126\\n\\n127\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0cRestriction of Use\\nBecause our report is prepared solely for and on behalf of the client, it does not constitute a basis for any reliance on is con-\\ntents by other third parties. Therefore, no claims of other third parties can be derived from it.\\n\\nConclusion\\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe \\nthat the Company’s ESG Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of section 267a \\nUGB and of the GRI Standards 2021.\\n\\nVienna \\nApril 6, 2022\\n\\nPwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH \\n\\nMarius Richter  \\nAustrian Certified Public Accountant\\n\\n127\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0cContact\\n\\nChristoph Rainer\\nTel: +43 (0) 664 80 1873 200\\nesg@ubm-development.com\\n\\nImprint\\n\\nMedia Proprietor and Publisher\\nUBM Development AG\\nLaaer-Berg-Strasse 43,  \\n1100 Vienna, Austria\\nTel: +43 (0) 50 1873 100\\nwww.ubm-development.com\\n\\nConcept, Design and Editing\\nUBM Development AG\\n\\nCreated with ns.publish, a product of \\nMultimedia Solutions AG, Zurich\\n\\nImage Section\\nCreative Director: Christine Eisl\\nEditing: Tobias Sckaer, Hans Fleißner\\nProduction: Michael Schmid\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nPhotography\\nPhilipp Horak\\nAstrid Knie\\nunsplash.com\\nUBM Development\\nKlaus Vyhnalek\\nCraig Dillon \\ngettyimages.com\\n\\nRenderings\\nbloomimages.com\\n\\nPictograms\\nflaticon.com\\n\\nPrinting\\nGerin Druck GmbH\\nGerinstraße 1–3, 2120 Wolkersdorf, Austria\\n\\nTranslation\\nDonna Schiller-Margolis\\n\\nThis  ESG  report  includes  forward-looking  statements  which  are  based  on  current  assumptions  and  estimates  made  to  the  best  of  their \\n\\nknowledge  by  the  management  of  UBM  Development  AG.  These  forward-looking  statements  can  be  identified  by  words  like  “expecta-\\n\\ntion“,  “goal“  or  similar  terms  and  expressions.  Forward-looking  statements,  by  definition,  include  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  forecasts  con-\\n\\ncerning  the  future  development  of  the  company  represent  estimates  which  are  based  on  the  information  available  at  the  time  the  annual \\n\\nreport  was  prepared.  If  the  assumptions  underlying  these  forecasts  do  not  materialise  or  if  unexpected  risks  occur  at  an  amount  not  quan-\\n\\ntified  or  quantifiable,  the  actual  future  development  and  actual  future  results  can  differ  from  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  forecasts. \\n\\nSignificant  factors  for  these  types  of  deviations  can  include,  for  example,  changes  in  the  general  economic  environment  or  the  legal  and  reg-\\n\\nulatory  framework  in  Austria  and  the  EU  as  well  as  changes  in  the  real  estate  sector.  UBM  Development  AG  will  not  guarantee  or  assume  any \\n\\nliability  for  the  agreement  of  future  development  and  future  results  with  the  estimates  and  assumptions  made  in  this  ESG  report.  UBM \\n\\nDevelopment  AG  will  not  update  these  forward-looking  statements  to  reflect  actual  events  or  changes  in  assumptions  and  expectations. \\n\\nThe ESG report as of 31 December 2021 was prepared with the greatest possible care to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information in all sec-\\n\\ntions. The amounts were rounded based on the compensated summation method. However, rounding, typesetting and printing errors cannot be excluded. \\n\\nThis ESG report is published in English and German and is available in both languages on the website of UBM Development AG. In the event of a \\n\\ndiscrepancy or deviation, the German language version takes precedence.\\n\\nThis ESG report was printed on Olin regular absolute white, an FSC-certified paper that meets the highest demands for environmental compatibility.\\n\\n202122019\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c\\x0c1.4.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GärtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signiﬁcance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the ﬁrst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG – it stands for the “S“ in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed  – just underscored – the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM’s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reﬂected in the focus on green building, green ﬁnancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conﬁrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the ﬁrst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signiﬁcance of ESG for UBM – also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.

Our business model.  \\nExplained in brief.\\n\\ngreen.  smart.  and  more.  That  summarises  the  strategy  of \\nUBM  Development  AG  in  four  words.  Explained  in  brief. \\nBecause  anyone  who  plans  for  the  future  must  develop \\nbuildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically \\nappealing, where people feel well. \\n\\nnow the determining factors for our actions. In 2021 UBM \\napplied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-\\nmitted  to  compliance  with  the  UN  Sustainable  Develop-\\nment  Goals,  and  became  an  ofﬁcial  supporter  of  the  Task \\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\n\\nWe  develop  properties  for  Europe’s  major  cities.  In  line \\nwith our core strategy, the focus is on green building and \\nsmart ofﬁce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, \\nMunich  and  Prague.  With  over  150  years  of  experience, \\nUBM provides a full range of development services – from \\nplanning to marketing – from a single source.\\n\\nEcological and social aspects play an important role in every \\ndecision  because  our  actions  today  design  the  working \\nand living space of tomorrow. Gold from EcoVadis, Prime  \\nStatus from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-\\ntiﬁcations in recent years underscore UBM’s commitment \\nto sustainability. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic signiﬁcantly increased the pace of \\nchange in this area. Ecological and social sustainability are \\n\\nUBM  Development  AG  is  listed  in  the  prime  market  seg-\\nment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets \\nthe highest transparency standards. That not only means \\nﬁnancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all \\nother aspects of the business model.\\n\\nUBM’s corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but \\nits activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-\\ntan regions in ﬁve countries – Germany, Austria, the Czech \\nRepublic,  Poland  and  the  Netherlands.  In  many  of  these \\nmarkets, UBM has been active as a real estate developer \\nfor many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner \\n– not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-\\nties and ﬁnancing banks.\\n \\n\\n2-1, 2-6\\n\\nT E A M   P E R F O R M A N C E   A L O N G   T H E   E N T I R E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nPlanning and \\nengineering\\n\\nProject \\n\\nmanagement\\n\\nFinancing\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nProperties for Europe‘s metropolises.  \\nSustainable, technologically and emotionally \\nintelligent and with added value. \\n\\nU B M   I N   E U R O P E\\n\\nWarsaw\\n\\nKatowice\\n\\nKrakow\\n\\nThe Hague\\n\\nHamburg\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nDüsseldorf\\n\\nFrankfurt\\n\\nPrague\\n\\nMunich\\n\\nVienna\\n\\nInnsbruck\\n\\nGraz\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nEvery decision we make in connection with the development \\nof a property has an impact on the global climate for the \\ncoming decades. It is a conviction that is also reflected in \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. \\n\\n \\n\\n1.2. Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand setting a value for the sale which can be included in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\nproﬁtability and risk. UBM’s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a “one-stop shop“. We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management, ﬁnancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor ﬁnal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM’s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and ofﬁce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM’s  core  markets  is  also  well-ﬁlled  for  the \\nfuture  with  €2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nofﬁce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue of roughly €300m in its standing investment portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM’s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n“Pure Play Developer“. Nearly 75% of the company’s book \\nvalue is attributable to development.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\nU B M   –   C O R E   C O M P E T E N C E\\n\\nsell with  \\nadded value\\n\\ndevelop\\n\\n10\\n\\nbuy\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nT H E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\n Acquisition\\n\\nZoning / \\n\\nbuilding rights\\n\\nS\\n\\nN\\n\\nA T I O\\n\\nAsset \\n\\nmanagement\\n\\nR\\n\\nE\\n\\nP\\n\\nO\\n\\nSale / \\nexit\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nP\\n\\nT\\n\\nI\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nRental / \\nmarketing\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n        Financing\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nI\\n\\nT\\n\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nI\\n\\nL\\n\\nA\\n\\nE\\n\\nR\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\nT\\n\\nR\\n\\nUCTION\\n\\n1.3.  Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM‘s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nreﬂected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe ﬁrst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the ﬁnancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM’s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM’s strate-\\ngic transformation into a “Pure Play Developer“, the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated – for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a “Pure Play Developer“, UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering – in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different  ﬁelds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate qualiﬁcations. There were no signiﬁcant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.  International presence  \\n\\nand stable shareholder structure \\n\\nUBM Development and its subsidiaries have an efﬁcient \\nlocal network which guarantees competitive positioning in \\nthe individual markets. In addition to the headquarters of \\nUBM Development AG in Vienna, the following operating \\nsubsidiaries are active in real estate development: \\n\\n(cid:132) \\n\\n UBM Development Deutschland GmbH and  \\nAlba Bau Projekt Management GmbH (Germany) \\n\\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Österreich GmbH (Austria) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Czechia s.r.o. (Czech Republic) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Polska sp.z o.o. (Poland) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Netherlands B.V. (Netherlands)\\n \\nThere were no signiﬁcant changes in the organisation dur-\\ning 2021. \\n\\nThe  share  capital  of  UBM  Development  AG  totalled \\n€22,416,540  as  of  31  December  2021  and  is  divided  into \\n7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising the IGO-Ortner \\nGroup and the Strauss Group held an unchanged 38.8% of \\nthe  shares  outstanding  at  year-end  2021.  In  addition,  the \\nIGO-Ortner  Group  held  6.8%  of  UBM  outside  the  syndi-\\ncate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a pri-\\nvate investor. Free ﬂoat comprised 49.4% of the shares and \\nincluded  the  3.9%  of  the  shares  held  by  the  Management \\nand  Supervisory  Boards.  Most  of  the  other  free  ﬂoat  was \\nheld by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%). \\n\\n2-1, 2-2, 2-9\\n\\n1.5. Teamwork, also at the top  \\n\\nCooperation  is  not  only  a  guiding  principle  for  UBM,  but \\nalso  a  quality  valued  by  top  management.  The  four-mem-\\nber Management Board – Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin \\nLöcker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO) and Martina Maly-Gärtner \\n(COO)  –  is  supported  by  the  Executive  Committee  as  an \\nextended management body.\\nThe  Executive  Committee  includes  the  four  Management \\nBoard members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-\\ntry  and  specialist  managers.  The  committee  meets  six  to \\neight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure \\ncontinuous calibration. The members of the Executive Com-\\nmittee,  in  total,  have  invested  approximately  €5m  in  UBM \\nshares and participate at 5% in an increase in the company’s \\nvalue through stock options.\\n\\nSustainability is an issue for management.  \\nBut not only. \\nThe  assignment  of  responsibilities  proves  that  sustain- \\nability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter \\nfor  management.  The  Management  Board  is  responsible \\nfor the organisation of and compliance with sustainability \\nissues. Thomas G. Winkler, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, is \\nin  charge  of  the  sustainability-relevant  areas  of  strategy, \\ninvestor  relations  &  ESG,  and  compliance.

The Executive \\nCommittee regularly deals with sustainability issues, espe-\\ncially  in  view  of  the  new  strategic  focus  on  green.  smart. \\nand more. \\n\\nUBM became one of the ﬁrst listed companies in Austria to \\nestablish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board in \\nFebruary 2021. As the senior controlling body, the Super-\\nvisory Board is now able to meet its responsibilities for the \\nenvironment, society and governance through a separate \\ncommittee.  The  ESG  Committee  deals  with  the  analysis \\nof sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts \\nin corporate processes – in particular, it deﬁnes the most \\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##important  ESG  factors  that  are  deter-\\nmined by the company’s sector afﬁliation \\nand  business  model  and  are  subject  to \\nregional inﬂuence.\\nThe  ESG  Committee  monitors  and  sup-\\nports  activities  in  line  with  the  ESG  cat-\\nalogue  of  measures  based  on  the  clear \\nassignment  of  responsibilities  at  Man-\\nagement  Board  and  Supervisory  Board \\nlevels.  It  also  supervises  and  evaluates \\nthe implemented ESG measures – above \\nall,  the \\nimpact  of  procurement  and \\ndevelopment processes on ecosystems, \\nthe use of resources, the direct and indi-\\nrect  neighbourhood,  and  good  corpo-\\nrate  management.  Additional  informa-\\ntion on the ESG Committee can be found \\nin the Annual Report for 2021 under the \\nCorporate  Governance  Report  starting \\non page 88. \\nThe inclusion of ESG factors in the remu-\\nneration  model  will  be  analysed  in  detail \\nin the future: Plans call for the integration \\nof  key  ESG  performance  indicators  in \\nmanagement’s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\nFurther information on the Supervisory Board and Manage-\\nment Board is provided in the Annual Report for 2021 under \\nthe Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88. \\n\\nShared values as the basis  \\nMany projects in many different countries – that demands a \\ncommon basis to make sure everyone pulls together. At UBM, \\nthis  means  a  clear  strategic  focus  and  shared  values.  The \\nfoundation is created by a system of values that is based on \\nthree  pillars:  competent.  consequent.  transparent.  Speciﬁ-\\ncally, that means: UBM stands for high technical competence, \\nconsequent actions and full transparency.  \\n\\n2-9, 2-13, 2-19, 2-22\\n\\n13\\n\\n Martina Maly-Gärtner (COO) , \\nThomas G. Winkler (CEO),  \\nMartin Löcker (COO), \\nPatric Thate (CFO), f.l.t.r.\\n\\nBased on these deﬁned values,  \\nwe have formulated the following binding goals:\\n\\none goal \\nstands for an increase in the value of the company. \\n\\none team  \\nexpresses the goal to grow even closer together  \\nas a corporate group. \\n\\none company  \\nreﬂects the clear understanding to deal with the \\noutside world as a single entity. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.6. Financial performance indicators\\n\\nBusiness development and earnings\\nWith after-tax proﬁt of €44m, UBM closed the 2021 ﬁnan-\\ncial  year  with  results  that  exceeded  expectations  at  the \\nstart  of  the  second  pandemic  year.  This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.  The  consequent  focus \\non green. smart. and more. also played an important role. \\nHowever,  successful  strategic  change  not  only  requires  a \\nsolid ﬁnancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever \\nbefore with an equity ratio of 37%.\\n\\nThis improvement was based primarily on property sales \\nin  Germany  and  Austria  as  well  as  the  progress  of  con-\\nstruction on previously sold real estate projects which are \\nrecognised over time in accordance with the progress of \\ncompletion and sale.\\n\\nThe  proﬁt  from  companies  accounted  for  at  equity  rose \\nto €36.0m in 2021 (2020: €27.8m). This improvement was \\nsupported, above all, by ongoing forward sold real estate \\nprojects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt. \\n\\nUBM  Development  generated  Total  Output  of  €471.0m  in \\n2021, compared with €478.6m in the previous year. Of this \\ntotal, €371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The \\nlargest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-\\nmany and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the \\npre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output \\nfor the reporting year was also inﬂuenced, above all, by the \\nprogress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-\\njects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-\\ncentage of completion and realisation. In this category, the \\nlargest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-\\ntial construction projects like the Gmunder Höfe in Munich \\nand  the  Siebenbrunnengasse  in  Vienna,  a  project  with  \\n178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-\\nitive  contributions  were  made  by  the  forward  sold  F.A.Z. \\nTower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. \\n\\nEBITDA rose by €10.8m over the previous year to €75.9m \\nin 2021. Depreciation and amortisation declined by 14.8% \\nto  €2.6m  (2020:  €3.1m),  and  EBIT  consequently  rose \\nby  €11.3m  to  €73.3m  (2020:  €62.0m).  Financial  income \\ndeclined from €23.9m in the previous year to €14.0m, and \\nﬁnancial costs amounted to €27.2m (2020: €23.7m). There \\nwere no material deviations in ﬁnancial costs during 2021 \\nor 2020.\\n\\nEBT  totalled  €60.1m  in  2021  and  was  €2.1m,  or  3.4%, \\nlower than the previous year (2020: €62.3m).

As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market. UBM shares are listed in Vienna‘s Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments ﬁts per-fectly with UBM’s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our ﬁnancing to green ﬁnancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top ﬁve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond ﬁnancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the ﬁrst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after ﬁve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM’s commitment to reach a speciﬁc ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green ﬁnancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green ﬁnancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit ﬁnancing represents the next step to even more green ﬁnancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for “green loans“. Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate ﬁnancing. Over the longer term, we also see “green bonds“ as attrac-tive tools for green ﬁnancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speciﬁc use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien für Europas Metropolen.

As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our ofﬁces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM’s training and educational programmes as well as our “UBM Day”, which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That’s more than all trafﬁc combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Efﬁcient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community “live“. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the ﬁrst time as a “green meeting“ in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements – from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering ﬁrm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the “Caritas am Himmel“ during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the “Lichtblickhof“ brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na‘s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations – and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM’s underground car park.

Our strategy \\n\\nProtecting  the  future  viability  of  our  planet  is  one  of  the \\nmost important social responsibilities of our time. With the \\nannouncement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-\\nscored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral \\ncontinent in the world by 2050. Other megatrends apart from \\necology are urbanisation and the demographic and social \\nshifts in the social order. “Silver Society“ describes the age-\\ning of society, in which health and the quality of life will be \\ndeeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. \\nChanging gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes \\nhave also led to radical changes in society and the business \\nsector. These developments, together with COVID-19, are the \\ndecisive factors for the megatrend “New Work” – meaning \\npeople’s needs as regards their working world.\\n\\nWe see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an \\nopportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor \\nfor  our  entrepreneurial  actions.  In  the  sense  of  ecological \\nsustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-\\nber construction developers in Europe. Our actions today \\nare already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-\\nible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s \\nusers. As a real estate developer, we can give the office a \\nnew  standing  as  a  communication  and  collaboration  plat-\\nform  –  the  physical  workplace  then  becomes  a  place  for \\ncommunity and corporate culture. As an employer, we also \\ntake  advantage  of  these  opportunities  –  for  example,  by  \\nbenefitting from the additional innovation potential created \\nby a diverse workforce. \\n\\nUBM  has  anchored  the  relevance  of  ESG  in  its  corporate \\nstrategy through the focus on green. smart. and more. and is \\nintroducing concrete measures. The efficient use of resources \\nis an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues \\nand adherence to compliance rules. UBM’s flagship projects, \\ngreen building certifications and the activities evolving from \\nthe green. smart. and more. strategy reflect the requirements \\nof the EU and create new opportunities for UBM.\\n\\ngreen. stands for measures in support of greening, meaning \\nthe redirection of the economy in line with the environment. \\nOur primary focus is on timber construction as well as renew-\\nable energies and green building certification.\\n\\nsmart.  expresses  our  commitment  to  intelligent  buildings. \\nWith the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be \\nadapted to meet the needs of users and, at the same time, \\noperations can be made more efficient.\\n\\nand  more.  means  we  tell  stories  with  our  buildings.  This \\ninvolves aesthetics, well-being and customer experience – a \\n“more“ that is perceptible all over.\\n\\nOur  sustainability  activities  are  based  on  the  applicable \\nrules and regulations in the countries where we are active. \\nFor example: government programmes in the countries rel-\\nevant for UBM cover issues like the expansion of renewable \\nenergy, the efficient use of energy, subsidy programmes for \\nenvironmentally  friendly  behaviour  and  the  strengthening \\nof fundamental and human rights, especially in the supply \\nchain. An additional framework is provided by national and \\nsupranational norms and standards, including the UN Global \\nCompact,  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the  EU \\nGreen Deal and the EU Taxonomy. We have implemented – \\nand regularly evaluate and improve – the necessary processes \\nto realise our ESG goals and related measures. Information \\non our 360° process landscape and measures is provided in \\nthe following sections of this report. \\n\\nLeading  worldwide  ESG  rating  agencies  have  confirmed \\nUBM’s strong position on the topic of sustainability.

In  addition,  the \\nWorks Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Aus-\\ntrian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number \\nof members to the Supervisory Board. The Annual General \\nMeeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the \\nend of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple \\nmajority  of  the  votes  cast.

In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n \\x1f Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer & training and education\\n \\x1f Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of “double materiality“, meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company’s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM’s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n \\x1f UBM’s impact on people, society and the environment \\n \\x1f The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n \\x1f The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM’s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK## \\x1f “Water consumption“ and “waste“ were combined \\n\\nunder “water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations“. \\n\\n \\x1f The new issue “sustainable procurement and regional \\n\\nadded value“ covers “social criteria in the supply chain“, \\n“ecological criteria in the supply chain“ and “regional \\neconomy & society“. \\n\\n \\x1f “Infrastructure and mobility“, which was previously \\n\\nincluded under “socio-cultural environment of projects“, \\nwas recorded separately.\\n\\n \\x1f The former issue “cooperations“ is still an integral part \\n\\nof UBM’s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2\\n\\nThe results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading.

Conscious handling of risks and  \\n\\ntheir effects\\n\\nThe  realistic  assessment  and  management  of  risks  repre-\\nsent an essential factor for business success and sustainable \\nmanagement. One related step was the announcement in \\n2021 of UBM’s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.). The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM’s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings (according to the respective national definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir activities on the environment. Economic success and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success – and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn the course of general risk management, the probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.

Relevant activities to reach \\nthis goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-\\ntion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-\\nagement are also important issues for UBM and are internally \\nmanaged and reported. \\n\\n \\nFewer standing assets\\nThe  strategic  focus  of  UBM’s  business  activities  includes \\nthe  development  and  sale  of  properties. Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties – here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.1.  Energy efficiency, renewable energies & \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n4.1.1. Importance of the issue \\nWith  the  Paris  Agreement,  nations  across  the  world  have \\nagreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially \\nbelow 2°C and, through further measures, to limit the increase \\nto 1.5°C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent \\nby 2050. Related activities include the European Commis-\\nsion‘s “Fit for 55“ package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n– including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers – are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole – reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI 3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction is responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction and operation of a building can be reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop “smart“ buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360° principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the “Next Level“ efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics – as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360° process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable  –  and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class – at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.  Our  business  partners \\nare required to meet the same high standards, for example \\nstrict environmental requirements for suppliers’ production \\nprocesses and building material components. Environmental \\nprotection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement \\n(further information can be found in section 6).\\n\\nThe focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations \\nis  also  increasing.  The  corporate  units  in  Austria  (AG  and \\nUBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified \\nunder  the  international  environmental  management  norm  \\nISO  14001  and  quality  management  norm  ISO  9001,  and \\nUBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022.

Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for \\nbuilding shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-\\nnical equipment. The use of timber as a building material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.

We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin 2022.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360° principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM underscored its commitment to sustainable building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe positive experience from this Vienna project was also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction. This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the “embodied carbon”, \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics \\non the timber market were a further source of uncertainty \\nduring the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber \\nprice stabilised at a level where this raw material is available \\nat a reasonable price. \\n\\nEnergy & CO2 intensity\\n \\x1f Reduction of primary energy requirements to national \\n\\nnearly zero energy building standards by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\\n \\x1f Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy \\n\\ncarriers to 50% by 2030\\n\\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined \\nthe primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-\\nning of technical building equipment in all new development \\nprojects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-\\ntems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-\\ntion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or \\nequipment.\\n\\nThe durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-\\nond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: \\nThe specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life \\nCycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle \\nAssessments  (LCA/lifecycle  evaluations).  These  planning \\ntools make it possible to determine and, where necessary, \\nto optimise the energy requirements and CO2 emissions of \\nbuildings from construction to maintenance and dismantling.\\n\\n70\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is based on the final energy requirements in the respective project. \\nThe energy intensity depends on the project specifics (asset class, countries) and is therefore subject to fluctuations.\\n\\nEnergy indicators – real estate development \\n\\nTotal calculated energy consumption [kWh]\\nGFA of development projects [m²]\\nCalculated energy intensity [kWh/m²]\\nDirect/Indirect GHG emissions [t]1\\nIntensity of GHG emissions [kg/m²]1\\nProperty area in total [m²]\\n\\n2021\\n\\n11,165,679\\n118,104\\n95\\n3,132\\n27\\n45,678\\n\\n2020\\n\\n9,515,538\\n129,269\\n74\\n2,460\\n19\\n47,783\\n\\n2019\\n\\n7,243,201\\n70,431\\n103\\n1,920\\n27\\n25,884\\n\\n1   Information on the emission factors used can be found in chapter 7.

Green \\nbuilding  certification  for  all  new  projects  is  a  mandatory \\nelement of the 360° principle. In addition, the profiles “dis- \\nmantling“ and “construction site“ were added to the certifica-\\ntion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project \\nin Vienna.  UBM  has  decided  to  extend  its  certifications  to \\nrefurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call \\nfor the continuation of this strategy.

These surveys \\nprovide  the  basis  for  defining  concrete  targets  to  reduce \\nemissions. Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles \\nwhen new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also \\ninvolves the availability of suitable charging stations near the \\nemployee‘s home. In 2021, UBM’s motor vehicle pool had 18 \\nvehicles with alternative drives.\\n\\nTravel\\n \\x1f Reduce CO2 in air travel by 25% (basis 2019) by 2025\\n\\nThe  Group-wide  travel  guideline  “think  before  you  travel” \\nmakes clear that business trips should only be taken when \\nabsolutely necessary. Rail travel must be given preference \\nfor shorter distances, and video conference portals should be \\nused more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group’s commu-\\nnity “live”. This event was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith a long list of requirements including environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM’s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group’s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001. ISO 50001 audits are scheduled for \\nGermany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will \\nfollow.\\n\\nAn important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will \\nbe expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more \\nexact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-\\nsions. This will support the development of further climate \\nprotection initiatives in the future.

The W3, a stand-\\ning asset in Vienna, already purchases green electricity and, \\nin addition to district heating, is also changing over to district \\ncooling. A “manage to green“ project is currently in progress \\nat the Poleczki Business Park in Poland. It involves the neutral-\\nisation of CO2 emissions  from the total electricity consump-\\ntion  in  2021  and  2022  through  certificates  because  green \\nelectricity is not available at that location.

In addition, a guide-\\nline for sustainable building operations will be prepared for \\nall tenants.   GRI 3-3\\n\\nIn property development, the early planning phase defines \\nthe scope of the ecological footprint – and can be seen as \\nthe key to an efficient circular economy. Our focus on struc-\\ntural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their \\ndurability and their recycling capability.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  anchors,  among  others,  the  transition \\nto a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-\\nstruction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits through prefabrication and modular construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.  Later  recycling  capacity  can  be \\nactively included as early as the planning stage, for example \\n\\n74\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions  over the \\nentire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping \\nwith the focus on sustainability.  GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n4.3.  Ground sealing, climate change  \\n\\nadjustments and biodiversity \\n\\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the \\nlocal fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate – local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands) – and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM’s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled – untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n \\x1f Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n\\n \\x1f Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe planning stage for all UBM projects must include and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall, for building sections with massive components as well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded “Gold“ \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM’s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource “land”, \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern.

Healthy building materials &  \\n\\nthe quality of life  \\n\\nThe use of healthy building materials has a positive influence \\non the indoor climate in UBM‘s buildings and the comfort for \\nresidents, office tenants and hotel guests. The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\n \\n \\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n78\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.6.  Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a “green meeting“ in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the “green and clean“ motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##80\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

It also covers a company‘s social responsibil-\\nity, in other words the impact of its actions on society.\\n\\n5.1.  Attractive employer &  \\ntraining and education \\n\\nThis also includes fair and responsible interaction with our \\nemployees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and \\nmen who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-\\nterm success and essential for the positive development of \\nour company. In this connection, we have defined the follow-\\ning focus areas:\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer and training & education \\n \\x1f Diversity and equal opportunities\\n \\x1f Health and occupational safety\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local \\ncommunities  and  neighbouring  residents.  Our  projects \\ncontribute to the quality of life for society. This applies, in \\nparticular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true \\nfor residential construction and office buildings. We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n \\x1f Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n \\x1f Infrastructure & mobility\\n \\x1f Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company’s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study “The State of Skills 2021“ shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems at several levels over the long term. Employees \\nwith insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their \\nactivities at a higher quality level – and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments take longer, and both quality and motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust respect human rights, reject child labour and forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive working conditions can damage a company’s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers in online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company’s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM’s success. UBM supports its \\nemployees in reaching their personal career goals and offers \\nthem opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and \\ndevelopment possibilities and numerous benefits.\\n\\nWith our values – competent. consequent. transparent. – we \\ncreate a working climate in which each person feels included, \\n\\nauthorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. \\nWe encourage our employees to be proactive through short \\ndecision paths and flat hierarchies.\\n\\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict com-\\npliance with the national and international rules and require-\\nments in the markets where we are active. We also base our \\nactions  on  agreements  that  include  the  Universal  Declara-\\ntion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the \\ninternational labour standards set by the International Labour \\nOrganisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created “new work zones“ serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders. In addi-\\ntion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise \\nevents like barista workshops and joint participation in sport \\nevents to promote teambuilding.\\n\\nWork-life balance\\nWe believe it is important to help our employees establish \\na healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and \\nfamily life. Individual working time models are part of our \\nefforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the \\ncompany agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family \\nmembers. Employees have access to special time off under \\ncertain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-\\ntled to parental leave.\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Open communications are a central \\nelement of our corporate values and  \\nan important building block for our \\nattractiveness as an employer.\\n\\nPerformance-based remuneration\\nWith very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that \\nare tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM \\nemployees participate in the company’s success.\\n\\nBenefits\\nAdditional benefits include, among others, the reimburse-\\nment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-\\nsidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-\\nance.  Special  projects  to  help  employees  remain  healthy \\ninclude  in-house  fitness  programmes  and  a  subsidy  for \\nannual membership in a fitness studio. An important part of \\nthis policy specifies that these benefits are also available to \\npart-time employees. In this respect, UBM does not differen-\\ntiate between full-time and part-time employees.\\n\\nCareer, training and continuing education  \\nSpecially  planned  training  and  continuing  education  pro-\\ngrammes are a fixed part of human resources development \\nat UBM. The basis is formed by the annual appraisal meet-\\ning,  which  includes  an  agreement  on  goals  and  specific \\ntraining measures together with the responsible supervisor. \\nUBM  actively  offers  numerous  educational  opportunities \\nranging  from  internal  workshops  and  idea  competitions \\nto external training programmes, but also encourages and \\nsupports the independent development of its employees.  \\nGRI  2-23, 2-25, 3-3, 401-2, 404-2\\n\\nWe actively offer numerous devel-\\nopment opportunities as part of our \\nhuman resources strategy, but also \\nencourage employees’ independent \\ndevelopment.\\n\\n5.1.3. Organisational structure  \\nAt  the  Management  Board  level,  the  COO  is  responsible \\nfor personnel-related issues which are centrally combined \\nunder human resources. The head of human resources meets \\nregularly  with  the  COO  to  discuss  developments  in  this \\narea. Targets, measures and the strategic focus are defined \\ntogether with the Management Board and communicated to \\nthe organisation.

A project is currently in progress to sup-\\nport the organised recording of employee appraisals.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created an additional challenge \\nby limiting the offering and resulting in the cancellation of \\ntraining courses and seminars. The percentage of employees \\nwho participated in training fell from 65% in 2020 to 35% in \\n2021. However, the average hours of training per employee \\nremained constant at around 17 hours.\\n\\nIn 2021, a special training initiative was launched in support \\nof ESG issues: Numerous employees voluntarily took part in \\nthe Climate Impact Day to improve their understanding of \\nESG. The active participation of all employees in this event is \\nplanned to begin in 2022. Other internal events and training \\n(e.g. internal courses, projects related to the green. smart. \\nand  more.  initiative)  and  targeted  internal  communication \\nwill create a greater awareness for the importance of ESG.   \\nGRI  2-23, 2-25, 3-3\\n\\n5.2. Diversity and equal opportunities\\n\\nA working environment free of discrimination and a culture \\nof  mutual  respect  and  appreciation  throughout  the  entire \\nworkforce – these are the requirements for equal opportu-\\nnities and diversity in a company. A company that does not \\npromote diversity and equal opportunities risks damage to \\nits reputation and, in the worst case, could be faced with legal \\nconsequences.\\n\\nPoor performance in this area can undermine a company’s \\nposition on the market and result in the loss of business part-\\nners and customers. Innovation potential is also lost when the \\npersonal backgrounds of employees (e.g. migration back-\\nground, nationality, family constellations) are ignored. \\n\\nThe lack of equal opportunities at the workplace (remunera-\\ntion etc.) can lead to lower employee motivation and higher \\nturnover, which means additional costs and time for new hir-\\ning. Moreover, there are signs that the legal requirements \\ngoverning equal opportunities will be strengthened in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nFair  treatment  of  our  employees  and  a  culture  of  mutual \\nrespect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all \\nemployees equally – regardless of their ethnic, national or \\nsocial background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or \\nreligious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic \\nor other standing. Decisive action is taken against any form \\nof discrimination.\\n\\n85\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK## Goal from our sustainability programme:\\n\\nOver 30% women  \\n\\nin management \\n\\npositions\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n \\x1f No salary differences between women and men by \\n\\n2025 (adjusted gender pay gap)\\n\\n \\x1f Increase percentage of women in management  \\n\\npositions to over 30% by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Increase percentage of women in the total workforce  \\n\\nto ca. 50% by 2025 \\n\\nDiversity has high priority for UBM. It allows us to utilise the \\nfull potential of the labour market and innovation by includ-\\ning people with different backgrounds and viewpoints. The \\nemployment of staff with different ages and experience is \\nencouraged (buddy principle), and the company is increasing \\nits efforts to raise the percentage of female employees in the \\norganisation.\\n\\nActivities to sustainably improve equal opportunities include \\nrecruiting that is focused on the search for suitable female \\ncandidates. Women are directly addressed through appro-\\npriate wording in job advertisements, and clear guidelines \\ngive preference to women when qualifications and experi-\\nence are equal. In new hiring, there are no salary differences \\nbetween the genders when the function, qualifications and \\nseniority are equal. Starting in 2022, we plan to calculate the \\nadjusted gender pay gap for the entire company as the basis \\nfor implementing specific measures.\\n\\nIn comparison with other companies in the real estate sector, \\nthe UBM Group had a positive standing with 25 women in \\nkey positions as of 31 December 2021 (Supervisory Board, \\nmanaging directors, authorised signatories and key staff at \\nUBM Development AG and its subsidiaries). A comparison \\nwith the 24 female managers in 2020 shows an improvement \\nin the share of women in leading positions. The percentage \\nof women in management positions equalled 26.6% and the \\npercentage in the total workforce equalled ca. 45% in 2021.\\n\\nSpecific instructions  \\ngive women preference  \\nwhen qualifications and  \\nexperience are equal.\\n\\nThe Supervisory Board does not follow a specific diversity \\nconcept with regard to the composition of the Management \\nand Supervisory Boards because the establishment of diver-\\nsity targets for control bodies is not seen as expedient or use-\\nful. Education and professional experience play a significant \\nrole because a person under consideration for a Supervisory \\nBoard position must be capable of optimally performing his \\nor her duties. These preconditions are not defined abstractly \\nin advance but evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Accord-\\ningly, the expertise and specific requirements for the respec-\\ntive appointment are the only decisive factors in preparing \\nproposals for the Annual General Meeting. Women represent \\n25% of the positions on the Management Board and 33% on \\nthe Supervisory Board.   GRI  2-9, 2-17, 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n86\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5.3. Health and safety\\n\\nWork absences can result in financial damages, the loss of \\nknow-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health \\nand injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-\\nical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-\\nistent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased \\nsickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are \\nassociated with health and injury risks, among others through \\nsevere or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-\\native effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-\\nistrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal \\nconsequences for the employer. \\n\\nOur  business  success  is  based  to  a  significant  degree  on \\nthe  commitment  and  motivation  of  our  employees. As  an \\nemployer,  we  also  feel  responsible  for  their  physical  and \\npsychological health. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n \\x1f Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level – \\n\\ngoal: zero work accidents \\n\\n \\x1f Protect and promote employees‘ health\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, support for employees’ physical \\nand psychological health in everyday office routines plays a \\ncentral role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-\\npational  physician,  in-house  fitness  rooms).  A  major  focal \\npoint  for  construction  sites  involves  occupational  safety \\nmeasures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection \\nincluding training).\\n\\nUBM has implemented an integrated management system to \\nsupport occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-\\nees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe success of these measures is reflected in the number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees’ health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms. Outdoor athletes can join the “UBM-Express” and \\ntake part in various running events. An occupational physi-\\ncian is also available to assist employees at UBM’s Vienna \\nlocation.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today’s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow’s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur many years of experience as a real estate developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and ÖGNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Accessibility\\n \\x1f Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n \\x1f Indoor climate and acoustics\\n \\x1f Security \\n \\x1f Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification  –  through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends – as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n88\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5.5. Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept – for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas well as sustainable mobility concepts (car/bike sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation. The following offering is \\ndesigned to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-\\ntally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-\\ning users:\\n\\n \\x1f E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for \\n\\ne-bike batteries \\n\\n \\x1f Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle\\n \\x1f E-bike hire stations\\n \\x1f Additional bicycle storage areas\\n \\x1f Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers \\n\\nand changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair \\npoint \\n\\nSome  of  these  services,  for  example  car  sharing  and  the \\ne-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in \\nthe neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower – which creates excellent and \\nefficient synergies for both buildings.\\n\\nAt the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be \\nable to use e-charging stations in the office and residential \\nareas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing \\nproducts.   \\n\\nThe Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, \\nis  currently  carrying  out  a  “manage  to  green“  project  that \\ninvolves  the  refitting  of  two  buildings  to  include  parking \\nspaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, \\ne-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking \\nspaces in the business park.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n5.6.  Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness of sustainability issues can also improve users’ sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM’s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens‘ initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nHöfe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject  –  and  for  all  other  UBM  developments  –  is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city’s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens’ concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone – an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n– is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and \\nshared activities, the use of a quarter management app is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases and improves the value of the area surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

That is the foundation of our business success.\\n\\nUBM’s  values  –  competent.  consequent.  transparent.  –  are \\nreflected  in  our  social  responsibility:  act  ethically,  accept \\nthe  consequences,  communicate  transparently.  To  ensure \\nthat our values are lived throughout the entire company and \\nreflected in our employees‘ everyday activities, our actions \\nare based on ethical principles, relevant national and inter-\\nnational legal norms, and internal guidelines. \\n\\nAs an active part of society, we accept our responsibility and \\nhave identified the following material subject areas as part \\nof our materiality analysis:\\n\\n \\x1f Corporate governance & compliance\\n \\x1f Sustainable procurement & regional added value\\n \\x1f Innovation & technologies\\n\\n6.1. Corporate governance & compliance \\n\\n6.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany’s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years – also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard (“Sustainable Corporate Governance“) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.   GRI 3-3\\n\\n94\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##6.1.2. Our commitment  \\nResponsible  actions  start  at  an  individual  level  but,  as  a \\ncompany,  we  have  a  duty  and  responsibility  to  create  the \\nnecessary framework. UBM does this, for example, through \\ntransparent internal directives and a code of conduct, com-\\nmitment to various corporate governance guidelines and the \\nUN Global Compact, and an effective internal compliance \\nmanagement system.\\n\\nResponsible and transparent management has top priority \\nfor UBM. Compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, \\nguidelines, standards and norms in the countries where UBM \\nis active goes without saying. The high demands we set for \\nourselves also apply to our business partners and employees. \\nUBM’s business model is oriented on ecological, social and \\nethically correct business practices. In order to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural \\nrequirements.\\n\\nUBM’s  focus  markets  are  strictly  regulated  and  controlled \\nlegal areas with high human rights standards. Nonetheless, \\nviolations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and \\nrespect  for  human  rights  is  therefore  anchored  in  internal \\nguidelines. We are committed to the ten principles of the UN \\nGlobal Compact which, for example, prohibit child labour \\nand forced labour. Our codes of conduct (ethic code and \\ncode of conduct for business partners) require guarantees \\nfor fair compensation, workplace safety, support for equal \\nopportunity and the freedom of association, for example.\\n\\nOur responsible and transparent management is based on \\nthe following cornerstones:\\n\\nAustrian Code of Corporate Governance\\nUBM,  as  an  international  listed  company,  has  pledged  its \\ncommitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a \\nvoluntary guideline for good management and control. The \\ncompany has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-\\nnal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions.\\n\\nCompliance Management System\\nThe compliance management system implemented by UBM \\nis intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal \\nregulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-\\ntions. A compliance management system manual details the \\nresponsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation \\nas well as the processes which implement the related rules \\nand  guidelines.  The  Management  Board  and  Supervisory \\nBoard consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-\\nsequent implementation of all compliance principles. Our \\napproach follows the principle of prevention – disclosure – \\nreaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect \\nbehaviour.\\n\\nThe trust of employees, business partners, customers and \\nother stakeholders is strengthened by UBM’s focus on trans-\\nparency,  anti-corruption,  fair  business  practices,  the  pre-\\nvention of money laundering and data protection. Internal \\nguidelines and work instructions form the framework for the \\nnecessary procedures – examples are:\\n\\nConsequent compliance with applicable national and inter-\\nnational legal norms as well as our ethical principles safe-\\nguards the trust of our stakeholders. We are non-partisan and \\ndo not make any donations to political parties.\\n\\nGuideline: Cartel and Competition Law  \\nAgreements and coordinated actions with third-party com-\\npanies  that  lead  to  –  or  aim  to  lead  to  –  the  restriction  of \\ncompetition are prohibited and will not be tolerated by UBM. \\n\\nGuideline: Anti-corruption \\nUBM  employees  are  prohibited,  without  exception,  from \\naccepting  or  granting  monetary  gifts.  Material  gifts  to \\nemployees of public organisations are also prohibited with-\\nout exception.

Further informa-\\ntion on the 360° process landscape can be found on page 97.\\n\\nGuideline: Conflicts of Interest  \\nUBM employees must make sure their own interests do not \\ncome into conflict with their professional obligations or coun-\\nter UBM’s obligations towards its business partners.  \\n\\nUBM operates a whistleblowing system as defined in Art. 32 of \\nthe EU’s Market Abuse Directive (“MAR“) which allows employ-\\nees and external persons to report irregularities and (potential) \\nviolations of this regulation. Reports can be submitted directly to \\na staff member in the compliance organisation or sent by email to  \\ncompliance@ubm-development.com or anonymously via the \\nlink https://secureveal.ubm-development.com. The reporting \\nof potential violations is in the interest of the Management \\nBoard as well as the management of the Group companies. In \\n\\nData protection\\nUBM is committed to the confidential and responsible handling  \\nof personal data in agreement with the applicable data pro-\\ntection laws – above all the EU Data Protection Regulation and \\nrelated national legislation. Secure handling is guaranteed \\nby a data protection manual that includes rules for internal \\ndata  processing,  work  procedures  and  their  monitoring.  \\nRegular  employee  training  and  surveys  create  a  greater \\nawareness of this sensitive issue and make sure data protec-\\ntion does not drift out of focus.\\n\\nEthics code\\nA separate, binding ethics code forms the basis for all busi-\\nness activities and decisions. It is the foundation for moral, \\nethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-\\nees and is designed to prevent mistakes.\\n\\nThe values and principles contained in the code are based \\non national and international laws and requirements and on \\nagreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\nthe  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  the  United \\nNations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-\\nness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-\\ntional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set \\nby the International Labour Organisation (in particular the \\nFundamental Principles of the IAO). \\n\\nThe subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among \\nothers, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-\\ntal  and  human  rights,  working  conditions,  occupational \\nsafety and health, environmental protection, the prevention \\nof  money  laundering,  and  data  protection.  This  code  has \\nbeen expressly agreed in writing with all employees in their \\n\\n96\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##national  language  since  2021  and  is  regularly  adapted  to \\nreflect developments in the social and regulatory environ-\\nment as well as ethic values. The last update was completed \\nin December 2021.\\n\\nFurther information on the ethics code can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item “ESG“. \\n\\nCode of conduct for business partners\\nWe not only place high priority on responsible actions by all \\nUBM employees, but also set high standards for our busi-\\nness partners. A separate code of conduct for our business \\npartners is firmly anchored in our corporate processes and \\nregularly adapted to reflect developments in the business \\nand regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic val-\\nues. The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and \\nincluded requirements for all business partners to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain.\\n\\nThis code is based on the same principles and regulations as \\nthe ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, \\nfair  competition,  fundamental  and  human  rights,  working \\nconditions,  occupational  safety  and  health,  environmental \\nprotection, the prevention of money laundering, and data \\nprotection. The code of conduct applies to all business part-\\nners who sell their products or services to UBM. If a business \\npartner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated \\ncontracts will not be signed and the compliance officer is \\nimmediately informed. He will then decide – together with the \\nManagement Board – on further procedures. In the event the \\ncode is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable \\nmeasures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-\\nsion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with \\nthe business partner. \\n\\nFurther information on the code of conduct for business part-\\nners can be found on our website under the menu item “ESG“.\\n\\nWorks Council  \\nUBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected \\nevery four years. Four of these members are delegated to \\nthe Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the \\nvotes.\\n\\nUBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the \\nrespective national frameworks as well as representation on \\nthe Supervisory Board. The Works Council also takes part in \\ncollective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with \\nUBM’s  approval. The  newly  founded  ESG  Committee  also \\nincludes one member from the Works Council.\\n\\nDuring the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or \\nviolations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBM‘s oper-\\nating locations or suppliers.\\n\\nTransparent processes \\nUBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which \\ngo beyond legal requirements. These processes are opera-\\ntionally standardised through an institutionalised 360° prin-\\nciple. More specifically: As part of the “Next Level“ efficiency \\nprogramme, all core and support processes for project devel-\\nopment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates \\nand  ultimately  defined  for  the  entire  company.  Roles  and \\nresponsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and \\nthe control mechanisms were revised and improved. These \\nprocedures  and  rules  give  employees  the  corresponding \\ntools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design \\nof processes and controls. \\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##We  are  convinced  that  these  types  of  work  instructions, \\nguidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-\\nmunication and documentation, and help to make processes \\nmore efficient. They also make effective controls possible.\\n\\nUBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-\\nance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and \\nto quickly identify and correct any weak points in business \\nand organisational processes, on the other hand.\\n\\nThe internal control system and internal audit \\nOur internal control system (ICS) is an integral part of our \\nbusiness processes. The most important goals of this control \\nsystem are to:\\n\\n \\x1f Monitor compliance with business policies  \\n\\nand defined goals\\n\\n \\x1f Safeguard the company’s assets \\n \\x1f Guarantee the reliability of accounting and reporting\\n \\x1f Maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of  \\n\\nbusiness processes\\n\\n \\x1f Identify risks at an early point in time\\n \\x1f Reliably assess potential risks\\n \\x1f Monitor compliance with legal requirements\\n \\x1f Ensure the efficient use of resources and cost savings \\n\\nIn addition to the controls in core processes, UBM has installed \\ncommercial and technical controlling functions. Both report \\ndirectly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling \\nmonitors the ongoing development of business to identify \\ndeviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes \\ncertain  management  receives  the  necessary  information. \\nTechnical  controlling  monitors  project  development  with \\na focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-\\ngress and all processes important for technical realisation.  \\nGRI 2-15, 2-23, 2-25, 2-26, 3-3, 205-2, 407-1\\n\\n6.1.3. Organisational structure  \\nCompliance management at UBM is installed in the legal, \\ncorporate and compliance department, which is also respon-\\nsible for the content of the related guidelines. A compliance \\nofficer  and  deputy  were  appointed  by  the  Management \\nBoard of UBM AG. The compliance guidelines are prepared \\nby the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-\\nment Board and communicated to all employees. All UBM \\nemployees have digital access to these guidelines. \\n\\nThe compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines \\nand is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes \\nin legal regulations. The compliance guidelines are reviewed \\nannually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and \\ninternal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of \\nthe compliance management system. \\n\\nThe key positions in the internal data protection organisation \\nare the data protection coordinator and one data protection \\nofficer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-\\nment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-\\nlation of a data breach response team for the management \\nand reporting of data protection violations in agreement with \\nthe data protection guideline.\\n\\nA  money  laundering  officer  has  also  been  appointed.  As \\npart of KYC reviews (“know your customer“), he compares \\nthe data received with sanction lists, entries in the register \\nof economic owners, etc. Additional information on the KYC \\nreviews can be found on page 100.\\n\\nThe respective organisational units implement the individual \\ninternal guidelines and work instructions.

Furthermore, there were no confirmed \\ncases where contracts with business partners were cancelled \\nor not extended due to violations involving corruption, and \\nno confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of \\nemployees due to corruption. There were no proceedings \\nfor anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-\\nination incidents.  \\n\\nWhistleblower system\\nThe whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover \\nviolations of data protection regulations and other report-\\nable incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. \\nIt will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports \\nin connection with UBM‘s ethics code and made available in \\nCzech and Polish.\\n\\n99\\n\\nQuality management system\\nISO  9001  certification  is  intended  to  make  sure  the  pro-\\ncess-oriented quality management system is based on the \\nhighest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG \\nand UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-\\ntified  under  the  international  quality  management  norm  \\nISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-\\ntification covered 62% of UBM’s workforce in 2021.\\n\\nRemuneration model\\nThe possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model \\nwill be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in \\nmanagement‘s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\n\\nImplement guidelines and prevent misconduct by \\nconsequent preventive activities\\nEmployee training  \\nThe goal of training is to create a greater awareness among \\nemployees  for  potential  sources  of  risk  and,  in  this  way, \\nprevent  corruption  and  anti-competitive  behaviour.  New \\nemployees  receive  training  from  the  compliance  depart-\\nment immediately after they join UBM. Regular e-learning \\nprogrammes cover compliance with guidelines on different \\nsubjects  like  the  anti-corruption  guideline  and  the  guide-\\nline on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to \\nensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, \\nand the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-\\npliance guideline to prevent market abuse.\\n\\nMost of the classroom training on compliance regulations \\nhas been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 \\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 174 employee \\ntraining courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance \\nissues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money \\nlaundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were \\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##reworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case \\nexamples.  \\n\\nThe compliance team frequently visits training courses, and \\nthere are additional certifications for selected responsibilities \\n(for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified \\nas a compliance officer under ISO 19600).\\n\\nThe  procedure  for  the  distribution  of  relevant  corporate \\nguidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-\\nees  will  be  notified  separately  of  any  relevant  changes  in \\nexisting guidelines.\\n\\nEthics code\\nThe ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees \\nin their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet \\nour sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-\\ngration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, \\nthe focus on human rights and environmental protection was \\nreinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG \\nis also supported by company events and training (like the \\nClimate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the \\ngreen. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal \\ncommunication.\\n\\nSampling controls of insider information\\nThe compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-\\nitor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider \\ninformation and confidential and price-sensitive information. \\nAdditional clarification briefings are held if necessary.\\n\\nPrevent money laundering and terrorism financing\\nKYC review of new business partners\\nKnow your customer is one of the basic principles underly-\\ning the guideline for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing and the work instructions on money \\nlaundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries and contracts with politically exposed persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities. The related activities are classified \\ninternationally as having an increased risk of money launder-\\ning, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated \\nregularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing. \\n\\nThe  risk  analysis  for  all  Austrian  subsidiaries  which  have \\nregistered brokerage as one of their commercial activities \\nwas updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the \\nrespective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement &  \\n\\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM’s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays “Think global, order local“. Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM‘s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the one hand, local companies are supported and, on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving timber construction. UBM created jobs and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM‘s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects.

About this report \\n\\nThis report is UBM’s second ESG report and fifth sustainability \\nreport. It provides information on the 2021 financial year of \\nUBM Development AG.\\n\\nUBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which \\nwas based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards  “Core \\nOption“.\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with § 267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-\\nentation of information from previous reports is documented \\nin the footnotes beginning on page 112. The reported indi-\\ncators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019.\\n\\nThe management of UBM Development AG is responsible \\nfor preparation of the report content. An external review with \\nlimited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125). \\n\\nIf you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please \\nfeel  free  to  contact  UBM  at  esg@ubm-development.com.  \\nCurrent information on sustainability can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item “ESG“. \\n\\nGender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-\\nsible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no \\ndistinction was made between the genders. In the sense of \\n\\nequal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to \\nall genders.\\n\\nScope of consolidation  \\nThis report covers the corporate locations, standing assets \\nand development projects of UBM Development in Austria, \\nGermany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets. \\n\\nIn  the  hotel  business,  which  was  a  focal  point  of  activities \\nbefore the strategic reorientation, UBM took over the role \\nof  the  lessee  in  selected  cases  following  the  sale  of  the \\nrespective properties. The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment, because UBM is unable to control the related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe indicators in the section on the environment cover all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and \\nimproved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based \\nprimarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database \\n(v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. \\n\\nWhere  actual  consumption  figures  are  not  available,  esti-\\nmates are used (mainly for project development, where the \\nenergy consumption is calculated as per certificates).\\n\\nDetails are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112.\\nGRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2\\n\\n106\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##7.2.

These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-\\npendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a \\nlimited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.  \\n\\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract \\n(AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors (https://www.ksw.or.at/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-\\n209/), which also apply towards third parties. As provided under section 275 para. 2 UGB (liability provision regarding the \\naudit of financial statements of small and medium-sized companies), our responsibility and liability towards the Company \\nand any third parties arising from the assurance engagement are limited to a total of EUR 2 million. \\n\\n125\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a \\nreasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is sub-\\nstantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. \\n\\nThe selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following: \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the overall presentation of the disclosures and non-financial information\\n \\x1f Critical assessment of the Company’s analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders by inter-\\n\\nviewing the responsible employees and inspecting relevant documents \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including the due diligence processes implemented \\n\\nas well as the processes used to ensure an accurate presentation in the ESG report by interviewing the Company’s \\nmanagement and inspecting internal guidelines, procedural instructions and management systems in connection with \\nnon-financial matters/disclosures \\n\\n \\x1f Obtaining an understanding of reporting processes by interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected docu-\\n\\nmentations \\n\\n \\x1f Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indica-\\n\\ntors, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.

Our business model.  \\nExplained in brief.\\n\\ngreen.  smart.  and  more.  That  summarises  the  strategy  of \\nUBM  Development  AG  in  four  words.  Explained  in  brief. \\nBecause  anyone  who  plans  for  the  future  must  develop \\nbuildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically \\nappealing, where people feel well. \\n\\nnow the determining factors for our actions. In 2021 UBM \\napplied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-\\nmitted  to  compliance  with  the  UN  Sustainable  Develop-\\nment  Goals,  and  became  an  of cial  supporter  of  the  Task \\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\n\\nWe  develop  properties  for  Europe s  major  cities.  In  line \\nwith our core strategy, the focus is on green building and \\nsmart of ce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, \\nMunich  and  Prague.  With  over  150  years  of  experience, \\nUBM provides a full range of development services   from \\nplanning to marketing   from a single source.\\n\\nEcological and social aspects play an important role in every \\ndecision  because  our  actions  today  design  the  working \\nand living space of tomorrow. Gold from EcoVadis, Prime  \\nStatus from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-\\nti cations in recent years underscore UBM s commitment \\nto sustainability. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic signi cantly increased the pace of \\nchange in this area. Ecological and social sustainability are \\n\\nUBM  Development  AG  is  listed  in  the  prime  market  seg-\\nment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets \\nthe highest transparency standards. That not only means \\n nancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all \\nother aspects of the business model.\\n\\nUBM s corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but \\nits activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-\\ntan regions in  ve countries   Germany, Austria, the Czech \\nRepublic,  Poland  and  the  Netherlands.  In  many  of  these \\nmarkets, UBM has been active as a real estate developer \\nfor many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner \\n  not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-\\nties and  nancing banks.\\n \\n\\n2-1, 2-6\\n\\nT E A M   P E R F O R M A N C E   A L O N G   T H E   E N T I R E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\nPlanning and \\nengineering\\n\\nProject \\n\\nmanagement\\n\\nFinancing\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nProperties for Europe s metropolises.  \\nSustainable, technologically and emotionally \\nintelligent and with added value. \\n\\nU B M   I N   E U R O P E\\n\\nWarsaw\\n\\nKatowice\\n\\nKrakow\\n\\nThe Hague\\n\\nHamburg\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nD sseldorf\\n\\nFrankfurt\\n\\nPrague\\n\\nMunich\\n\\nVienna\\n\\nInnsbruck\\n\\nGraz\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nEvery decision we make in connection with the development \\nof a property has an impact on the global climate for the \\ncoming decades. It is a conviction that is also reflected in \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. \\n\\n \\n\\n1.2. Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand setting a value for the sale which can be included in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\npro tability and risk. UBM s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a  one-stop shop . We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management,  nancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor  nal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and of ce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM s  core  markets  is  also  well- lled  for  the \\nfuture  with   2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nof ce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue of roughly  300m in its standing investment portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n Pure Play Developer . Nearly 75% of the company s book \\nvalue is attributable to development.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\nU B M       C O R E   C O M P E T E N C E\\n\\nsell with  \\nadded value\\n\\ndevelop\\n\\n10\\n\\nbuy\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nT H E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\n Acquisition\\n\\nZoning / \\n\\nbuilding rights\\n\\nS\\n\\nN\\n\\nA T I O\\n\\nAsset \\n\\nmanagement\\n\\nR\\n\\nE\\n\\nP\\n\\nO\\n\\nSale / \\nexit\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nP\\n\\nT\\n\\nI\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nRental / \\nmarketing\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n        Financing\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nI\\n\\nT\\n\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nI\\n\\nL\\n\\nA\\n\\nE\\n\\nR\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\nT\\n\\nR\\n\\nUCTION\\n\\n1.3.  Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nre ected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe  rst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the  nancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM s strate-\\ngic transformation into a  Pure Play Developer , the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated   for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a  Pure Play Developer , UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering   in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different   elds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate quali cations. There were no signi cant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.  International presence  \\n\\nand stable shareholder structure \\n\\nUBM Development and its subsidiaries have an ef cient \\nlocal network which guarantees competitive positioning in \\nthe individual markets. In addition to the headquarters of \\nUBM Development AG in Vienna, the following operating \\nsubsidiaries are active in real estate development: \\n\\n(cid:132) \\n\\n UBM Development Deutschland GmbH and  \\nAlba Bau Projekt Management GmbH (Germany) \\n\\n(cid:132)  UBM Development  sterreich GmbH (Austria) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Czechia s.r.o. (Czech Republic) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Polska sp.z o.o. (Poland) \\n(cid:132)  UBM Development Netherlands B.V. (Netherlands)\\n \\nThere were no signi cant changes in the organisation dur-\\ning 2021. \\n\\nThe  share  capital  of  UBM  Development  AG  totalled \\n 22,416,540  as  of  31  December  2021  and  is  divided  into \\n7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising the IGO-Ortner \\nGroup and the Strauss Group held an unchanged 38.8% of \\nthe  shares  outstanding  at  year-end  2021.  In  addition,  the \\nIGO-Ortner  Group  held  6.8%  of  UBM  outside  the  syndi-\\ncate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a pri-\\nvate investor. Free  oat comprised 49.4% of the shares and \\nincluded  the  3.9%  of  the  shares  held  by  the  Management \\nand  Supervisory  Boards.  Most  of  the  other  free   oat  was \\nheld by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%). \\n\\n2-1, 2-2, 2-9\\n\\n1.5. Teamwork, also at the top  \\n\\nCooperation  is  not  only  a  guiding  principle  for  UBM,  but \\nalso  a  quality  valued  by  top  management.  The  four-mem-\\nber Management Board   Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin \\nL cker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO) and Martina Maly-G rtner \\n(COO)     is  supported  by  the  Executive  Committee  as  an \\nextended management body.\\nThe  Executive  Committee  includes  the  four  Management \\nBoard members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-\\ntry  and  specialist  managers.  The  committee  meets  six  to \\neight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure \\ncontinuous calibration. The members of the Executive Com-\\nmittee,  in  total,  have  invested  approximately   5m  in  UBM \\nshares and participate at 5% in an increase in the company s \\nvalue through stock options.\\n\\nSustainability is an issue for management.  \\nBut not only. \\nThe  assignment  of  responsibilities  proves  that  sustain- \\nability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter \\nfor  management.  The  Management  Board  is  responsible \\nfor the organisation of and compliance with sustainability \\nissues. Thomas G. Winkler, the Chief Executive Of cer, is \\nin  charge  of  the  sustainability-relevant  areas  of  strategy, \\ninvestor  relations  &  ESG,  and  compliance.  Green  build-\\ning and timber construction report to Martin L cker, while \\nPatric  Thate  makes  sure  the   nancing  turns   green   and \\noversees  the  implementation  of  ESG  data  management. \\nEmployees  &  work  safety  as  well  as  hotel  operations  are \\nthe responsibility of Martina Maly-G rtner.

Financial performance indicators\\n\\nBusiness development and earnings\\nWith after-tax pro t of  44m, UBM closed the 2021  nan-\\ncial  year  with  results  that  exceeded  expectations  at  the \\nstart  of  the  second  pandemic  year.  This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.  The  consequent  focus \\non green. smart. and more. also played an important role. \\nHowever,  successful  strategic  change  not  only  requires  a \\nsolid  nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever \\nbefore with an equity ratio of 37%.\\n\\nThis improvement was based primarily on property sales \\nin  Germany  and  Austria  as  well  as  the  progress  of  con-\\nstruction on previously sold real estate projects which are \\nrecognised over time in accordance with the progress of \\ncompletion and sale.\\n\\nThe  pro t  from  companies  accounted  for  at  equity  rose \\nto  36.0m in 2021 (2020:  27.8m). This improvement was \\nsupported, above all, by ongoing forward sold real estate \\nprojects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt. \\n\\nUBM  Development  generated  Total  Output  of   471.0m  in \\n2021, compared with  478.6m in the previous year. Of this \\ntotal,  371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The \\nlargest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-\\nmany and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the \\npre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output \\nfor the reporting year was also in uenced, above all, by the \\nprogress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-\\njects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-\\ncentage of completion and realisation. In this category, the \\nlargest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-\\ntial construction projects like the Gmunder H fe in Munich \\nand  the  Siebenbrunnengasse  in  Vienna,  a  project  with  \\n178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-\\nitive  contributions  were  made  by  the  forward  sold  F.A.Z. \\nTower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. \\n\\nEBITDA rose by  10.8m over the previous year to  75.9m \\nin 2021. Depreciation and amortisation declined by 14.8% \\nto   2.6m  (2020:   3.1m),  and  EBIT  consequently  rose \\nby   11.3m  to   73.3m  (2020:   62.0m).  Financial  income \\ndeclined from  23.9m in the previous year to  14.0m, and \\n nancial costs amounted to  27.2m (2020:  23.7m). There \\nwere no material deviations in  nancial costs during 2021 \\nor 2020.\\n\\nEBT  totalled   60.1m  in  2021  and  was   2.1m,  or  3.4%, \\nlower than the previous year (2020:  62.3m). Tax expense \\nequalled   16.4m,  compared  with   21.5m  in  2020,  and \\nrepresented a tax rate of 27.3% (2020: 34.5%). The lower \\ntax rate in the reporting year resulted from the tax effects \\nof equity-accounted results and a special effect from the \\nsale of a project in Austria. \\n\\nRevenue  as  reported  on  the  consolidated  income  state-\\nment  increased  by  51.8%  to   278.3m  (2020:   183.3m). \\n\\nPro t  for  the  period  (net  pro t  after  tax)  totalled   43.7m \\nin  2021  (2020:   40.8m).  Net  pro t  attributable  to  the \\n\\n14\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nshareholders of the parent company amounted to  33.6m \\nfor the reporting year (2020:  32.8m). Beginning with the \\n2020   nancial  year,  the  calculation  of  net  pro t  attribut-\\nable to the shareholders of the parent company includes \\na deduction for the share attributable to the hybrid capi-\\ntal holders; the comparative prior year data were adjusted \\naccordingly.  The  share  attributable  to  the  hybrid  capital \\nholders  rose  from   7.0m  to   8.6m  in  the  2021   nancial \\nyear following the issue of a new hybrid bond during the  \\nsecond quarter of 2021. The resulting earnings per share \\nrose from  4.39 to  4.50 in 2021.\\n\\nAsset and  nancial position\\nTotal assets recorded by the UBM Group rose by  122.4m \\nover  the  previous  year  to   1,494.5m  as  of  31  December \\n2021. This increase was supported, above all, by the issue \\nof  two  sustainability-linked  corporate  bonds  which  will \\nprovide added  nancial  exibility for business activities.\\n\\nNon-current assets declined slightly by  0.3m to  824.6m \\nat year-end 2021. Property, plant and equipment totalled \\n 12.9m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31  December  2020: \\n 11.6m).  This  position  consists  primarily  of  capitalised \\nrights of use from leases, which totalled  8.8m at the end \\nof 2021. \\n\\nCurrent assets rose by  122.8m over the level at year-end \\n2020  to   669.8m  as  of  31  December  2021.  This  increase \\nwas based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash \\nreceivables, which grew by  176.1m to  423.3m. \\n\\nEquity  totalled   550.6m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31 \\nDecember  2020:   482.9m)  and  was  increased  primarily \\nby the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30 35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was  nalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.  Nearly  50%  of  the \\n2018  hybrid  bond  was  redeemed  prematurely,  and  this \\n nancing was extended to 2026. \\n\\nBond  liabilities  totalled   526.5m  at  the  end  of  December \\n2021 and were  70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-\\nvious year (31 December 2020:  456.5m). A  7.0m bearer \\nbond  (term  2021 2025)  and  a  further   0.5m  bearer  bond \\n(term  2021 2025)  were  issued  in  the   rst  quarter  of  2021. \\nIn  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  UBM  issued  a  sustain- \\nability-linked bond (term: 2021 2026). The issue volume of \\n 150.0m included  68.9m from the exchange of the exist-\\ning  bond  2017 2022.  A  promissory  note  loan  and  bearer \\nbond (term: 2016 2021) were repaid in December 2021.\\n\\nNet  debt  was  substantially  lower  than  the  previous  year \\nat  381.0m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \\n 479.1m).  This  indicator  represents  current  and  non-cur-\\nrent  bonds  and   nancial  liabilities,  excluding  lease  liabil-\\nities,  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  decline  in  net \\ndebt  resulted,  above  all,  from  distributions  from  equity- \\naccounted  companies,  property  sales  and  an  increase  in \\n nancial liabilities as support for investments.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAIL16\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAILESG   which stands for Environment, Social, Governance   is an integral part  of our strategy.

The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments  ts per-fectly with UBM s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our  nancing to green  nancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans . Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate  nancing. Over the longer term, we also see  green bonds  as attrac-tive tools for green  nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speci c use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien f r Europas Metropolen.

Sustainability  not only demands an ecological approach  but also socially farsighted thinking. We are working, step by step, to build  a UBM that also leads the way with  high social competence. As an employer,  we support cooperation and fairness.  As a developer, we create innovative  building concepts for generations to come.  And as a good corporate citizen, we live  our responsibility to society.UBM IN DETAIL27\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2828The DIY developerSocial aspects are just as important for green thinking. As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our of ces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead,  50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria s only stationary children s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in dif cult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankesch n\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM s underground car park\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##3131UBM IN DETAILDay in the other UBM countries as a  xed part of our schedule starting in 2022.  smart  and  green travelling  as education In October 2021, roughly 30 of our colleagues travelled to Berlin to learn about the realisation of smart of ce building ideas on site and, above all, to also experience the UBM community outside the of ce. A number of colleagues involved with UBM s  green  strategy took a trip to the Austrian province of Vorarl-berg at the same time, where they reviewed model pro-jects and workshops for timber construction. The participants in both trips gained new impressions and valuable impulses for their future work and for cooperation throughout the UBM Group.

With the \\nannouncement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-\\nscored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral \\ncontinent in the world by 2050. Other megatrends apart from \\necology are urbanisation and the demographic and social \\nshifts in the social order.  Silver Society  describes the age-\\ning of society, in which health and the quality of life will be \\ndeeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. \\nChanging gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes \\nhave also led to radical changes in society and the business \\nsector. These developments, together with COVID-19, are the \\ndecisive factors for the megatrend  New Work    meaning \\npeople s needs as regards their working world.\\n\\nWe see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an \\nopportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor \\nfor  our  entrepreneurial  actions.  In  the  sense  of  ecological \\nsustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-\\nber construction developers in Europe. Our actions today \\nare already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-\\nible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow s \\nusers. As a real estate developer, we can give the office a \\nnew  standing  as  a  communication  and  collaboration  plat-\\nform     the  physical  workplace  then  becomes  a  place  for \\ncommunity and corporate culture. As an employer, we also \\ntake  advantage  of  these  opportunities     for  example,  by  \\nbenefitting from the additional innovation potential created \\nby a diverse workforce. \\n\\nUBM  has  anchored  the  relevance  of  ESG  in  its  corporate \\nstrategy through the focus on green. smart. and more. and is \\nintroducing concrete measures. The efficient use of resources \\nis an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues \\nand adherence to compliance rules. UBM s flagship projects, \\ngreen building certifications and the activities evolving from \\nthe green. smart. and more. strategy reflect the requirements \\nof the EU and create new opportunities for UBM.\\n\\ngreen. stands for measures in support of greening, meaning \\nthe redirection of the economy in line with the environment. \\nOur primary focus is on timber construction as well as renew-\\nable energies and green building certification.\\n\\nsmart.  expresses  our  commitment  to  intelligent  buildings. \\nWith the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be \\nadapted to meet the needs of users and, at the same time, \\noperations can be made more efficient.\\n\\nand  more.  means  we  tell  stories  with  our  buildings.

A structured, methodical process \\nallowed external stakeholders to contribute their views and \\nexpress their concerns. Roughly 700 women and men from 12 \\npre-defined stakeholder groups (see page 44) were invited \\n\\n43\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##to take part in an online survey   208 evaluable results were \\nreceived and integrated into the materiality analysis.\\n\\nBased on the responses from these stakeholder groups, the \\nmajor issues were identified, structured and evaluated.

Gross risks were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n \\x1f Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer & training and education\\n \\x1f Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n \\x1f UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n \\x1f The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n \\x1f The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK## \\x1f  Water consumption  and  waste  were combined \\n\\nunder  water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations . \\n\\n \\x1f The new issue  sustainable procurement and regional \\n\\nadded value  covers  social criteria in the supply chain , \\n ecological criteria in the supply chain  and  regional \\neconomy & society . \\n\\n \\x1f  Infrastructure and mobility , which was previously \\n\\nincluded under  socio-cultural environment of projects , \\nwas recorded separately.\\n\\n \\x1f The former issue  cooperations  is still an integral part \\n\\nof UBM s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2\\n\\nThe results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading.

Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.). The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings (according to the respective national definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir activities on the environment. Economic success and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success   and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn the course of general risk management, the probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance. The main goals are described on page \\n39, the details on page 50.

ESG reporting\\n\\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-\\ntrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has \\nvoluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in \\nline with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, \\nthe company is very well prepared to address the information \\nrequirements at the product and corporate levels that will \\nresult from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. \\n\\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing \\nregulatory developments   for example, the materiality analy-\\nsis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-\\nover, UBM s reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and \\nnorms like the UN Global Compact (see section 3.9.). This \\nESG  report  serves  as  a  progress  report  for  the  UN  Global \\nCompact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD \\nrecommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this \\nreport for the first time (see section 3.6.).\\n\\nIn connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the \\ncoming  years  which  were  set  in  2021,  the  ESG  report  is  a \\nvaluable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-\\nity  to  society.  The  ESG  report  describes  the  management \\napproaches, goals and measures related to the environment, \\nsociety and governance, and highlights successes as well as \\nchallenges. The subject areas are based on the materiality \\nanalysis carried out in 2021.

Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties   here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.1.  Energy efficiency, renewable energies & \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n4.1.1. Importance of the issue \\nWith  the  Paris  Agreement,  nations  across  the  world  have \\nagreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially \\nbelow 2 C and, through further measures, to limit the increase \\nto 1.5 C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world s first climate-neutral continent \\nby 2050. Related activities include the European Commis-\\nsion s  Fit for 55  package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n  including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers   are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole   reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI 3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction is responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction and operation of a building can be reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop  smart  buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360  principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the  Next Level  efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics   as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360  process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable     and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class   at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.

Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for \\nbuilding shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-\\nnical equipment. The use of timber as a building material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. An \\nactive commitment to sustainability best practices makes it \\npossible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to opti-\\nmise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 \\nemissions.\\n\\nopment AG  and  UBM Austria  are  also  certified  under  the  \\nISO 50001 energy management norm. Our binding ethics \\ncode,  in  which  the  subject  of  environmental  protection  is \\nanchored, creates the foundation for all business activities \\nand decisions, whereby compliance is confirmed in writing \\nby our employees (see section 6 for further information).\\n\\nThe United Nations recommends three steps to achieve cli-\\nmate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, \\nfinally,  compensate  for  unavoidable  emissions.  We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin 2022. This non-profit foundation includes partners from \\nindustry  and  science  who  work  together  to  develop  tech-\\nnical applications for smart buildings. The foundation com-\\nplements our green. smart. and more. strategy and will con-\\ntribute to achieving greater sustainability in the real estate \\nsector. Its goals include the long-term reduction of emissions \\nand resource consumption as well as the optimisation of eco-\\nnomic feasibility for sustainable office and residential con-\\ncepts.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360  principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM underscored its commitment to sustainable building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe positive experience from this Vienna project was also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction. This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the  embodied carbon , \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics \\non the timber market were a further source of uncertainty \\nduring the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber \\nprice stabilised at a level where this raw material is available \\nat a reasonable price. \\n\\nEnergy & CO2 intensity\\n \\x1f Reduction of primary energy requirements to national \\n\\nnearly zero energy building standards by 2025\\n\\n \\x1f Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\\n \\x1f Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy \\n\\ncarriers to 50% by 2030\\n\\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined \\nthe primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-\\nning of technical building equipment in all new development \\nprojects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-\\ntems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-\\ntion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or \\nequipment.\\n\\nThe durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-\\nond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: \\nThe specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life \\nCycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle \\nAssessments  (LCA/lifecycle  evaluations).

Green \\nbuilding  certification  for  all  new  projects  is  a  mandatory \\nelement of the 360  principle. In addition, the profiles  dis- \\nmantling  and  construction site  were added to the certifica-\\ntion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project \\nin Vienna.  UBM  has  decided  to  extend  its  certifications  to \\nrefurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call \\nfor the continuation of this strategy.

Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles \\nwhen new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also \\ninvolves the availability of suitable charging stations near the \\nemployee s home.

Rail travel must be given preference \\nfor shorter distances, and video conference portals should be \\nused more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group s commu-\\nnity  live . This event was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith a long list of requirements including environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001. ISO 50001 audits are scheduled for \\nGermany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will \\nfollow.\\n\\nAn important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will \\nbe expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more \\nexact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-\\nsions.

Our focus on struc-\\ntural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their \\ndurability and their recycling capability.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  anchors,  among  others,  the  transition \\nto a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-\\nstruction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits through prefabrication and modular construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.

The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate   local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands)   and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled   untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n \\x1f Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n\\n \\x1f Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe planning stage for all UBM projects must include and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall, for building sections with massive components as well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded  Gold  \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource  land , \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern.

The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\n \\n \\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n78\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.6.  Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the  green and clean  motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##80\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

Attractive employer &  \\ntraining and education \\n\\nThis also includes fair and responsible interaction with our \\nemployees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and \\nmen who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-\\nterm success and essential for the positive development of \\nour company. In this connection, we have defined the follow-\\ning focus areas:\\n\\n \\x1f Attractive employer and training & education \\n \\x1f Diversity and equal opportunities\\n \\x1f Health and occupational safety\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local \\ncommunities  and  neighbouring  residents.  Our  projects \\ncontribute to the quality of life for society. This applies, in \\nparticular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true \\nfor residential construction and office buildings. We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n \\x1f Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n \\x1f Infrastructure & mobility\\n \\x1f Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study  The State of Skills 2021  shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems at several levels over the long term. Employees \\nwith insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their \\nactivities at a higher quality level   and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments take longer, and both quality and motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust respect human rights, reject child labour and forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive working conditions can damage a company s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers in online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM s success. UBM supports its \\nemployees in reaching their personal career goals and offers \\nthem opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and \\ndevelopment possibilities and numerous benefits.\\n\\nWith our values   competent. consequent. transparent.   we \\ncreate a working climate in which each person feels included, \\n\\nauthorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. \\nWe encourage our employees to be proactive through short \\ndecision paths and flat hierarchies.\\n\\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict com-\\npliance with the national and international rules and require-\\nments in the markets where we are active. We also base our \\nactions  on  agreements  that  include  the  Universal  Declara-\\ntion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the \\ninternational labour standards set by the International Labour \\nOrganisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created  new work zones  serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders. In addi-\\ntion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise \\nevents like barista workshops and joint participation in sport \\nevents to promote teambuilding.\\n\\nWork-life balance\\nWe believe it is important to help our employees establish \\na healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and \\nfamily life. Individual working time models are part of our \\nefforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the \\ncompany agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family \\nmembers. Employees have access to special time off under \\ncertain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-\\ntled to parental leave.\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Open communications are a central \\nelement of our corporate values and  \\nan important building block for our \\nattractiveness as an employer.\\n\\nPerformance-based remuneration\\nWith very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that \\nare tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM \\nemployees participate in the company s success.\\n\\nBenefits\\nAdditional benefits include, among others, the reimburse-\\nment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-\\nsidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-\\nance.  Special  projects  to  help  employees  remain  healthy \\ninclude  in-house  fitness  programmes  and  a  subsidy  for \\nannual membership in a fitness studio.

Innovation potential is also lost when the \\npersonal backgrounds of employees (e.g. migration back-\\nground, nationality, family constellations) are ignored. \\n\\nThe lack of equal opportunities at the workplace (remunera-\\ntion etc.) can lead to lower employee motivation and higher \\nturnover, which means additional costs and time for new hir-\\ning. Moreover, there are signs that the legal requirements \\ngoverning equal opportunities will be strengthened in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nFair  treatment  of  our  employees  and  a  culture  of  mutual \\nrespect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all \\nemployees equally   regardless of their ethnic, national or \\nsocial background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or \\nreligious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic \\nor other standing.

Health and safety\\n\\nWork absences can result in financial damages, the loss of \\nknow-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health \\nand injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-\\nical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-\\nistent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased \\nsickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are \\nassociated with health and injury risks, among others through \\nsevere or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-\\native effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-\\nistrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal \\nconsequences for the employer. \\n\\nOur  business  success  is  based  to  a  significant  degree  on \\nthe  commitment  and  motivation  of  our  employees. As  an \\nemployer,  we  also  feel  responsible  for  their  physical  and \\npsychological health. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n \\x1f Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level   \\n\\ngoal: zero work accidents \\n\\n \\x1f Protect and promote employees  health\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, support for employees  physical \\nand psychological health in everyday office routines plays a \\ncentral role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-\\npational  physician,  in-house  fitness  rooms).  A  major  focal \\npoint  for  construction  sites  involves  occupational  safety \\nmeasures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection \\nincluding training).\\n\\nUBM has implemented an integrated management system to \\nsupport occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-\\nees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe success of these measures is reflected in the number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees  health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur many years of experience as a real estate developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and  GNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Accessibility\\n \\x1f Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n \\x1f Indoor climate and acoustics\\n \\x1f Security \\n \\x1f Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification     through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends   as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.

Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept   for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas well as sustainable mobility concepts (car/bike sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation.

Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness of sustainability issues can also improve users  sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens  initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nH fe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject     and  for  all  other  UBM  developments     is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens  concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone   an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n  is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and \\nshared activities, the use of a quarter management app is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases and improves the value of the area surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

To  ensure \\nthat our values are lived throughout the entire company and \\nreflected in our employees  everyday activities, our actions \\nare based on ethical principles, relevant national and inter-\\nnational legal norms, and internal guidelines. \\n\\nAs an active part of society, we accept our responsibility and \\nhave identified the following material subject areas as part \\nof our materiality analysis:\\n\\n \\x1f Corporate governance & compliance\\n \\x1f Sustainable procurement & regional added value\\n \\x1f Innovation & technologies\\n\\n6.1. Corporate governance & compliance \\n\\n6.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years   also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard ( Sustainable Corporate Governance ) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.

Our commitment  \\nResponsible  actions  start  at  an  individual  level  but,  as  a \\ncompany,  we  have  a  duty  and  responsibility  to  create  the \\nnecessary framework. UBM does this, for example, through \\ntransparent internal directives and a code of conduct, com-\\nmitment to various corporate governance guidelines and the \\nUN Global Compact, and an effective internal compliance \\nmanagement system.\\n\\nResponsible and transparent management has top priority \\nfor UBM. Compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, \\nguidelines, standards and norms in the countries where UBM \\nis active goes without saying. The high demands we set for \\nourselves also apply to our business partners and employees. \\nUBM s business model is oriented on ecological, social and \\nethically correct business practices. In order to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural \\nrequirements.\\n\\nUBM s  focus  markets  are  strictly  regulated  and  controlled \\nlegal areas with high human rights standards. Nonetheless, \\nviolations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and \\nrespect  for  human  rights  is  therefore  anchored  in  internal \\nguidelines. We are committed to the ten principles of the UN \\nGlobal Compact which, for example, prohibit child labour \\nand forced labour. Our codes of conduct (ethic code and \\ncode of conduct for business partners) require guarantees \\nfor fair compensation, workplace safety, support for equal \\nopportunity and the freedom of association, for example.\\n\\nOur responsible and transparent management is based on \\nthe following cornerstones:\\n\\nAustrian Code of Corporate Governance\\nUBM,  as  an  international  listed  company,  has  pledged  its \\ncommitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a \\nvoluntary guideline for good management and control. The \\ncompany has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-\\nnal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions.\\n\\nCompliance Management System\\nThe compliance management system implemented by UBM \\nis intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal \\nregulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-\\ntions. A compliance management system manual details the \\nresponsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation \\nas well as the processes which implement the related rules \\nand  guidelines.  The  Management  Board  and  Supervisory \\nBoard consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-\\nsequent implementation of all compliance principles. Our \\napproach follows the principle of prevention   disclosure   \\nreaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect \\nbehaviour.\\n\\nThe trust of employees, business partners, customers and \\nother stakeholders is strengthened by UBM s focus on trans-\\nparency,  anti-corruption,  fair  business  practices,  the  pre-\\nvention of money laundering and data protection.

It is the foundation for moral, \\nethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-\\nees and is designed to prevent mistakes.\\n\\nThe values and principles contained in the code are based \\non national and international laws and requirements and on \\nagreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\nthe  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  the  United \\nNations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-\\nness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-\\ntional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set \\nby the International Labour Organisation (in particular the \\nFundamental Principles of the IAO). \\n\\nThe subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among \\nothers, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-\\ntal  and  human  rights,  working  conditions,  occupational \\nsafety and health, environmental protection, the prevention \\nof  money  laundering,  and  data  protection.  This  code  has \\nbeen expressly agreed in writing with all employees in their \\n\\n96\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##national  language  since  2021  and  is  regularly  adapted  to \\nreflect developments in the social and regulatory environ-\\nment as well as ethic values.

The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and \\nincluded requirements for all business partners to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain.\\n\\nThis code is based on the same principles and regulations as \\nthe ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, \\nfair  competition,  fundamental  and  human  rights,  working \\nconditions,  occupational  safety  and  health,  environmental \\nprotection, the prevention of money laundering, and data \\nprotection. The code of conduct applies to all business part-\\nners who sell their products or services to UBM. If a business \\npartner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated \\ncontracts will not be signed and the compliance officer is \\nimmediately informed. He will then decide   together with the \\nManagement Board   on further procedures. In the event the \\ncode is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable \\nmeasures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-\\nsion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with \\nthe business partner. \\n\\nFurther information on the code of conduct for business part-\\nners can be found on our website under the menu item  ESG .\\n\\nWorks Council  \\nUBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected \\nevery four years. Four of these members are delegated to \\nthe Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the \\nvotes.\\n\\nUBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the \\nrespective national frameworks as well as representation on \\nthe Supervisory Board. The Works Council also takes part in \\ncollective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with \\nUBM s  approval. The  newly  founded  ESG  Committee  also \\nincludes one member from the Works Council.\\n\\nDuring the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or \\nviolations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBM s oper-\\nating locations or suppliers.\\n\\nTransparent processes \\nUBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which \\ngo beyond legal requirements. These processes are opera-\\ntionally standardised through an institutionalised 360  prin-\\nciple. More specifically: As part of the  Next Level  efficiency \\nprogramme, all core and support processes for project devel-\\nopment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates \\nand  ultimately  defined  for  the  entire  company.  Roles  and \\nresponsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and \\nthe control mechanisms were revised and improved. These \\nprocedures  and  rules  give  employees  the  corresponding \\ntools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design \\nof processes and controls. \\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##We  are  convinced  that  these  types  of  work  instructions, \\nguidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-\\nmunication and documentation, and help to make processes \\nmore efficient.

The compliance guidelines are reviewed \\nannually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and \\ninternal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of \\nthe compliance management system. \\n\\nThe key positions in the internal data protection organisation \\nare the data protection coordinator and one data protection \\nofficer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-\\nment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-\\nlation of a data breach response team for the management \\nand reporting of data protection violations in agreement with \\nthe data protection guideline.\\n\\nA  money  laundering  officer  has  also  been  appointed.

Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries and contracts with politically exposed persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities.

Sustainable procurement &  \\n\\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays  Think global, order local . Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the one hand, local companies are supported and, on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving timber construction. UBM created jobs and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-\\nscored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification \\nof most of our commercial projects   including residential \\nconstruction in the future   based on recognised sustainability \\nseals like DNGB,  GNI, LEED or BREEAM.\\n\\nThe green. smart. and more. initiative\\nIn line with the above-mentioned management approach, \\nthe green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. \\nIt is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that \\ncovered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The \\nfocus was placed on the following seven core issues which \\nwere defined in a dialogue between the Management Board \\nand Executive Committee:\\n\\nThese certifications also involve external experts and auditors \\nto confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. \\nMinimising the environmental impact of a building during its \\nentire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating \\nenergy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning \\nstage. The economic dimension covers the construction costs \\nas well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire \\nusage period or lifetime of the building.

Innovation & technologies  \\n\\nInternal and external research activities and innovations for \\nsustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value \\nchain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are \\nconsidered. The use of smart building technology (e.g. sen-\\nsors for smart ventilation, intelligent shading), for example, \\ncan make an important contribution to energy savings and \\nefficiency improvements and, in this way, reduce the negative \\nimpact on people and the environment. An urban quarter \\nthat incorporates social aspects, e.g. communication areas, \\ninteractive commercial areas (co-working spaces, etc.) con-\\ntributes to the social structure and interaction in the quarter.\\n\\nsmart. is UBM s keyword above all for new optimisation and \\ncontrol technologies as well as digitalisation. These activities \\nare focused on the following:\\n\\nIdeas and concepts were developed for these core areas as \\nanswers to the challenges created by climate change. The \\nprevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building \\nmaterials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-\\ngration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-\\nwords. The areas of Design & Construction, Energy and Build-\\ning  Operations,  in  particular,  offer   green   starting  points. \\nUBM responded with the following flagship projects:\\n\\n \\x1f Timber high-rise  Timber Pioneer  (Frankfurt)\\n \\x1f Quarter certification for the LeopoldQuartier (Vienna)\\n \\x1f barany.7 timber residential construction (Vienna)\\n \\x1f Green & Clean Hotel (Katowice)\\n\\nThe goals for green building certification were also reset.

UBM has made massive investments in the \\nGroup s digitalisation in recent years and plans to continue \\nthese efforts in the future.\\n\\nUBM launched the  Next Level  project in 2017 to digitally \\nmap operating and work processes as well as reporting and \\ncontrolling at corporate level. The  newBM  project started in \\n2020 and is intended to move digitalisation at UBM a great \\nqualitative leap forward, especially in the commercial areas \\nbut also in IT and infrastructure.\\n\\nThe  newBM  project included the development of an SAP \\nS/4 HANA system based on standard processes and SAP best \\npractices for 250 companies. A modern system supports the \\nfull digital management of HR processes, and a central treas-\\nury  system  safeguards  the  encrypted,  safe  and  integrated \\nhandling of payment flows throughout the Group.

About this report \\n\\nThis report is UBM s second ESG report and fifth sustainability \\nreport. It provides information on the 2021 financial year of \\nUBM Development AG.\\n\\nUBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which \\nwas based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards   Core \\nOption .\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with   267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-\\nentation of information from previous reports is documented \\nin the footnotes beginning on page 112. The reported indi-\\ncators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019.\\n\\nThe management of UBM Development AG is responsible \\nfor preparation of the report content. An external review with \\nlimited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125). \\n\\nIf you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please \\nfeel  free  to  contact  UBM  at  esg@ubm-development.com.  \\nCurrent information on sustainability can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item  ESG . \\n\\nGender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-\\nsible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no \\ndistinction was made between the genders. In the sense of \\n\\nequal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to \\nall genders.\\n\\nScope of consolidation  \\nThis report covers the corporate locations, standing assets \\nand development projects of UBM Development in Austria, \\nGermany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets. \\n\\nIn  the  hotel  business,  which  was  a  focal  point  of  activities \\nbefore the strategic reorientation, UBM took over the role \\nof  the  lessee  in  selected  cases  following  the  sale  of  the \\nrespective properties. The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment, because UBM is unable to control the related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe indicators in the section on the environment cover all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and \\nimproved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based \\nprimarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database \\n(v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. \\n\\nWhere  actual  consumption  figures  are  not  available,  esti-\\nmates are used (mainly for project development, where the \\nenergy consumption is calculated as per certificates).\\n\\nDetails are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112.\\nGRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2\\n\\n106\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##7.2.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.

Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand setting a value for the sale which can be included in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\npro tability and risk. UBM s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a  one-stop shop . We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management,  nancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor  nal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and of ce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM s  core  markets  is  also  well- lled  for  the \\nfuture  with   2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nof ce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue of roughly  300m in its standing investment portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n Pure Play Developer . Nearly 75% of the company s book \\nvalue is attributable to development.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\nU B M       C O R E   C O M P E T E N C E\\n\\nsell with  \\nadded value\\n\\ndevelop\\n\\n10\\n\\nbuy\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nT H E   V A L U E   C H A I N\\n\\n Acquisition\\n\\nZoning / \\n\\nbuilding rights\\n\\nS\\n\\nN\\n\\nA T I O\\n\\nAsset \\n\\nmanagement\\n\\nR\\n\\nE\\n\\nP\\n\\nO\\n\\nSale / \\nexit\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nP\\n\\nT\\n\\nI\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nRental / \\nmarketing\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n        Financing\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\nI\\n\\nT\\n\\nA\\n\\nS\\n\\nI\\n\\nL\\n\\nA\\n\\nE\\n\\nR\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\nT\\n\\nR\\n\\nUCTION\\n\\n1.3.  Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nre ected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe  rst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the  nancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM s strate-\\ngic transformation into a  Pure Play Developer , the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated   for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a  Pure Play Developer , UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering   in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different   elds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate quali cations. There were no signi cant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.

Financial performance indicators\\n\\nBusiness development and earnings\\nWith after-tax pro t of  44m, UBM closed the 2021  nan-\\ncial  year  with  results  that  exceeded  expectations  at  the \\nstart  of  the  second  pandemic  year.  This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.  The  consequent  focus \\non green. smart. and more. also played an important role. \\nHowever,  successful  strategic  change  not  only  requires  a \\nsolid  nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever \\nbefore with an equity ratio of 37%.\\n\\nThis improvement was based primarily on property sales \\nin  Germany  and  Austria  as  well  as  the  progress  of  con-\\nstruction on previously sold real estate projects which are \\nrecognised over time in accordance with the progress of \\ncompletion and sale.\\n\\nThe  pro t  from  companies  accounted  for  at  equity  rose \\nto  36.0m in 2021 (2020:  27.8m). This improvement was \\nsupported, above all, by ongoing forward sold real estate \\nprojects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt. \\n\\nUBM  Development  generated  Total  Output  of   471.0m  in \\n2021, compared with  478.6m in the previous year. Of this \\ntotal,  371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The \\nlargest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-\\nmany and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the \\npre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output \\nfor the reporting year was also in uenced, above all, by the \\nprogress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-\\njects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-\\ncentage of completion and realisation. In this category, the \\nlargest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-\\ntial construction projects like the Gmunder H fe in Munich \\nand  the  Siebenbrunnengasse  in  Vienna,  a  project  with  \\n178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-\\nitive  contributions  were  made  by  the  forward  sold  F.A.Z. \\nTower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. \\n\\nEBITDA rose by  10.8m over the previous year to  75.9m \\nin 2021. Depreciation and amortisation declined by 14.8% \\nto   2.6m  (2020:   3.1m),  and  EBIT  consequently  rose \\nby   11.3m  to   73.3m  (2020:   62.0m).  Financial  income \\ndeclined from  23.9m in the previous year to  14.0m, and \\n nancial costs amounted to  27.2m (2020:  23.7m). There \\nwere no material deviations in  nancial costs during 2021 \\nor 2020.\\n\\nEBT  totalled   60.1m  in  2021  and  was   2.1m,  or  3.4%, \\nlower than the previous year (2020:  62.3m). Tax expense \\nequalled   16.4m,  compared  with   21.5m  in  2020,  and \\nrepresented a tax rate of 27.3% (2020: 34.5%). The lower \\ntax rate in the reporting year resulted from the tax effects \\nof equity-accounted results and a special effect from the \\nsale of a project in Austria. \\n\\nRevenue  as  reported  on  the  consolidated  income  state-\\nment  increased  by  51.8%  to   278.3m  (2020:   183.3m). \\n\\nPro t  for  the  period  (net  pro t  after  tax)  totalled   43.7m \\nin  2021  (2020:   40.8m).  Net  pro t  attributable  to  the \\n\\n14\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nshareholders of the parent company amounted to  33.6m \\nfor the reporting year (2020:  32.8m).

The  share  attributable  to  the  hybrid  capital \\nholders  rose  from   7.0m  to   8.6m  in  the  2021   nancial \\nyear following the issue of a new hybrid bond during the  \\nsecond quarter of 2021. The resulting earnings per share \\nrose from  4.39 to  4.50 in 2021.\\n\\nAsset and  nancial position\\nTotal assets recorded by the UBM Group rose by  122.4m \\nover  the  previous  year  to   1,494.5m  as  of  31  December \\n2021. This increase was supported, above all, by the issue \\nof  two  sustainability-linked  corporate  bonds  which  will \\nprovide added  nancial  exibility for business activities.\\n\\nNon-current assets declined slightly by  0.3m to  824.6m \\nat year-end 2021. Property, plant and equipment totalled \\n 12.9m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31  December  2020: \\n 11.6m).  This  position  consists  primarily  of  capitalised \\nrights of use from leases, which totalled  8.8m at the end \\nof 2021. \\n\\nCurrent assets rose by  122.8m over the level at year-end \\n2020  to   669.8m  as  of  31  December  2021.  This  increase \\nwas based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash \\nreceivables, which grew by  176.1m to  423.3m. \\n\\nEquity  totalled   550.6m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31 \\nDecember  2020:   482.9m)  and  was  increased  primarily \\nby the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30 35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was  nalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.  Nearly  50%  of  the \\n2018  hybrid  bond  was  redeemed  prematurely,  and  this \\n nancing was extended to 2026. \\n\\nBond  liabilities  totalled   526.5m  at  the  end  of  December \\n2021 and were  70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-\\nvious year (31 December 2020:  456.5m). A  7.0m bearer \\nbond  (term  2021 2025)  and  a  further   0.5m  bearer  bond \\n(term  2021 2025)  were  issued  in  the   rst  quarter  of  2021. \\nIn  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  UBM  issued  a  sustain- \\nability-linked bond (term: 2021 2026). The issue volume of \\n 150.0m included  68.9m from the exchange of the exist-\\ning  bond  2017 2022.  A  promissory  note  loan  and  bearer \\nbond (term: 2016 2021) were repaid in December 2021.\\n\\nNet  debt  was  substantially  lower  than  the  previous  year \\nat  381.0m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \\n 479.1m).  This  indicator  represents  current  and  non-cur-\\nrent  bonds  and   nancial  liabilities,  excluding  lease  liabil-\\nities,  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  decline  in  net \\ndebt  resulted,  above  all,  from  distributions  from  equity- \\naccounted  companies,  property  sales  and  an  increase  in \\n nancial liabilities as support for investments.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAIL16\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAILESG   which stands for Environment, Social, Governance   is an integral part  of our strategy.

This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans . Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate  nancing. Over the longer term, we also see  green bonds  as attrac-tive tools for green  nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speci c use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien f r Europas Metropolen.

As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our of ces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM s underground car park.

Gross risks were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n  Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n  Attractive employer & training and education\\n  Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n  UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n  The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n  The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##   Water consumption  and  waste  were combined \\n\\nunder  water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations . \\n\\n  The new issue  sustainable procurement and regional \\n\\nadded value  covers  social criteria in the supply chain , \\n ecological criteria in the supply chain  and  regional \\neconomy & society . \\n\\n   Infrastructure and mobility , which was previously \\n\\nincluded under  socio-cultural environment of projects , \\nwas recorded separately.\\n\\n  The former issue  cooperations  is still an integral part \\n\\nof UBM s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2\\n\\nThe results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading.

Conscious handling of risks and  \\n\\ntheir effects\\n\\nThe  realistic  assessment  and  management  of  risks  repre-\\nsent an essential factor for business success and sustainable \\nmanagement. One related step was the announcement in \\n2021 of UBM s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.). The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings (according to the respective national definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir activities on the environment. Economic success and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success   and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn the course of general risk management, the probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance. The main goals are described on page \\n39, the details on page 50.

ESG reporting\\n\\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-\\ntrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has \\nvoluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in \\nline with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, \\nthe company is very well prepared to address the information \\nrequirements at the product and corporate levels that will \\nresult from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. \\n\\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing \\nregulatory developments   for example, the materiality analy-\\nsis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-\\nover, UBM s reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and \\nnorms like the UN Global Compact (see section 3.9.). This \\nESG  report  serves  as  a  progress  report  for  the  UN  Global \\nCompact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD \\nrecommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this \\nreport for the first time (see section 3.6.).\\n\\nIn connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the \\ncoming  years  which  were  set  in  2021,  the  ESG  report  is  a \\nvaluable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-\\nity  to  society.  The  ESG  report  describes  the  management \\napproaches, goals and measures related to the environment, \\nsociety and governance, and highlights successes as well as \\nchallenges. The subject areas are based on the materiality \\nanalysis carried out in 2021. The ESG report is prepared by \\nthe investor relations & ESG department in coordination with \\nthe specialist departments and released by the Management \\nBoard. Additional information on UBM, its business devel-\\nopment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 \\nannual report.\\n\\nTransparency  and  reliability  are  also  decisive  for  our  ESG \\nreporting,  and  we  therefore  arranged  for  an  external  lim-\\nited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is \\nprovided on page 125). UBM also introduced a central data \\nmanagement tool in 2021 which will be successively filled \\nstarting in 2022. The goal is to create an informative basis \\nfor the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. \\nControlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while \\ndata collection takes place directly in the respective areas \\nand departments in the individual countries.

It there-\\nfore goes without saying that ecological aspects play a key \\nrole in all our decisions. Our focus on green building, our \\ncommitment to wood construction, and renewable energies \\nand energy efficiency are an expression of this conviction.\\n\\nFuture-oriented real estate development\\nAs a real estate developer, we design the living space of the \\nfuture   and that means we also design the environment. Real \\nestate development is not only our core business, it also gives \\nus the greatest leverage to significantly reduce our carbon \\nfootprint. Consequently, UBM directly addresses the ecolog-\\n\\nical impact of its activities in all project phases with a con-\\nstant focus on environmental protection and the careful use \\nof resources. \\n\\nOur activities concentrate on the following areas:  \\n\\n  Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n  Durability and recyclability of materials\\n  Ground sealing, climate change and biodiversity\\n  Refurbishment and revitalisation\\n  Healthy building materials and the quality of life\\n\\n \\nReal estate development projects\\n\\nProjects\\n\\nTotal pipeline1\\n\\nGFA (Gross Floor Area) total [m ]\\nGFA Office  [m ]\\nGFA Hotel  [m ]\\nGFA Residential  [m ]\\nGFA Other and Mix [m ]\\nProjects   all asset classes [number]\\nOffice [number]\\nHotel [number]\\nResidential [number]\\nOther and Mix [number]\\n\\n711,709\\n133,765\\n129,899\\n382,121\\n65,924\\n54\\n9\\n8\\n35\\n2\\n\\n2021\\n\\n118,104\\n5,430\\n51,149\\n47,072\\n14,453\\n10\\n1\\n4\\n4\\n1\\n\\n2020\\n\\n129,269\\n44,407\\n8,046\\n76,816\\n0\\n10\\n2\\n1\\n7\\n0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n70,431\\n2,451\\n39,010\\n28,260\\n710\\n8\\n1\\n3\\n3\\n1\\n\\n1   The data covers all projects in the pipeline, including the projects completed in 2021.\\n\\nWe measure our locations based on their footprint\\nIn addition to our development projects, we want to make \\nour  own  business  operations  more  sustainable.  UBM  has \\noffice space at 19 locations. Our goal in this area is to steadily \\nreduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach \\nthis goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-\\ntion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-\\nagement are also important issues for UBM and are internally \\nmanaged and reported. \\n\\n \\nFewer standing assets\\nThe  strategic  focus  of  UBM s  business  activities  includes \\nthe  development  and  sale  of  properties. Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties   here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.1.  Energy efficiency, renewable energies & \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n4.1.1. Importance of the issue \\nWith  the  Paris  Agreement,  nations  across  the  world  have \\nagreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially \\nbelow 2 C and, through further measures, to limit the increase \\nto 1.5 C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world s first climate-neutral continent \\nby 2050. Related activities include the European Commis-\\nsion s  Fit for 55  package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n  including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers   are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole   reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI 3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction is responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction and operation of a building can be reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop  smart  buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360  principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the  Next Level  efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics   as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360  process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable     and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class   at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.  Our  business  partners \\nare required to meet the same high standards, for example \\nstrict environmental requirements for suppliers  production \\nprocesses and building material components. Environmental \\nprotection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement \\n(further information can be found in section 6).\\n\\nThe focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations \\nis  also  increasing.  The  corporate  units  in  Austria  (AG  and \\nUBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified \\nunder  the  international  environmental  management  norm  \\nISO  14001  and  quality  management  norm  ISO  9001,  and \\nUBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022.

Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for \\nbuilding shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-\\nnical equipment. The use of timber as a building material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. An \\nactive commitment to sustainability best practices makes it \\npossible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to opti-\\nmise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 \\nemissions.\\n\\nopment AG  and  UBM Austria  are  also  certified  under  the  \\nISO 50001 energy management norm. Our binding ethics \\ncode,  in  which  the  subject  of  environmental  protection  is \\nanchored, creates the foundation for all business activities \\nand decisions, whereby compliance is confirmed in writing \\nby our employees (see section 6 for further information).\\n\\nThe United Nations recommends three steps to achieve cli-\\nmate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, \\nfinally,  compensate  for  unavoidable  emissions.  We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin 2022. This non-profit foundation includes partners from \\nindustry  and  science  who  work  together  to  develop  tech-\\nnical applications for smart buildings. The foundation com-\\nplements our green. smart. and more. strategy and will con-\\ntribute to achieving greater sustainability in the real estate \\nsector. Its goals include the long-term reduction of emissions \\nand resource consumption as well as the optimisation of eco-\\nnomic feasibility for sustainable office and residential con-\\ncepts.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360  principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM underscored its commitment to sustainable building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe positive experience from this Vienna project was also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction. This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the  embodied carbon , \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics \\non the timber market were a further source of uncertainty \\nduring the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber \\nprice stabilised at a level where this raw material is available \\nat a reasonable price. \\n\\nEnergy & CO2 intensity\\n  Reduction of primary energy requirements to national \\n\\nnearly zero energy building standards by 2025\\n\\n  Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\\n  Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy \\n\\ncarriers to 50% by 2030\\n\\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined \\nthe primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-\\nning of technical building equipment in all new development \\nprojects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-\\ntems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-\\ntion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or \\nequipment.\\n\\nThe durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-\\nond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: \\nThe specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life \\nCycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle \\nAssessments  (LCA/lifecycle  evaluations).

The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group s commu-\\nnity  live . This event was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith a long list of requirements including environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001.

Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits through prefabrication and modular construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.  Later  recycling  capacity  can  be \\nactively included as early as the planning stage, for example \\n\\n74\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions  over the \\nentire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping \\nwith the focus on sustainability.  GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n4.3.  Ground sealing, climate change  \\n\\nadjustments and biodiversity \\n\\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the \\nlocal fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate   local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands)   and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled   untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n  Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n\\n  Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe planning stage for all UBM projects must include and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall, for building sections with massive components as well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded  Gold  \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource  land , \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern. It will be reflected in future projects through roof-\\ntops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and \\nfacade greening   which will help to reduce the heat island \\neffect in our urban areas as well as the heating and cooling \\nload.\\n\\nUBM s focal points for biodiversity are as follows:\\n\\n  Brownfield developments\\n  Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities\\n  Increase in biological diversity through roof and  \\n\\nfacade greening \\n\\n  Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening\\n\\nGoal from our sustainability programme:\\n\\nBrownfield  \\ndevelopment\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nBrownfield development\\n  Increase share of brownfield developments  \\n\\nin new projects to over 66% by 2025\\n\\nAs mentioned above, UBM s acquisition process is focused \\non brownfield developments (land with existing buildings). \\nBiodiversity has been integrated in UBM s 360  process land-\\nscape.

Stricter  legal  requirements \\nfor  building  demolition  can  be  expected  in  the  future,  for \\nexample through the consequent separation of construction \\nand demolition waste or the production of quality-assured \\nsecondary building materials.\\n\\nRefurbishment projects are a fixed and steadily increasing \\ncomponent of UBM s real estate development portfolio. In \\ncomparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-\\ntion,  the  conversion  and  vitalisation  of  existing  buildings \\nresults in lower energy consumption and lower CO2 emis-\\nsions   an important ecological aspect that will also be taken \\ninto account in the future. Other resource-conserving benefits \\ninclude the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new \\nsoil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and \\n\\nthe preservation of existing building substance. The lifecycle \\nof a building is extended as a result, and that reduces CO2 \\nemissions.\\n\\nUBM has increased its focus on projects involving revitalisa-\\ntion and has also set a goal to evaluate all refurbishment pro-\\njects based on sustainability criteria.

Healthy building materials &  \\n\\nthe quality of life  \\n\\nThe use of healthy building materials has a positive influence \\non the indoor climate in UBM s buildings and the comfort for \\nresidents, office tenants and hotel guests. The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\n \\n \\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n78\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.6.  Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the  green and clean  motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##80\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

Attractive employer &  \\ntraining and education \\n\\nThis also includes fair and responsible interaction with our \\nemployees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and \\nmen who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-\\nterm success and essential for the positive development of \\nour company. In this connection, we have defined the follow-\\ning focus areas:\\n\\n  Attractive employer and training & education \\n  Diversity and equal opportunities\\n  Health and occupational safety\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local \\ncommunities  and  neighbouring  residents.  Our  projects \\ncontribute to the quality of life for society. This applies, in \\nparticular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true \\nfor residential construction and office buildings. We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n  Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n  Infrastructure & mobility\\n  Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study  The State of Skills 2021  shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems at several levels over the long term. Employees \\nwith insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their \\nactivities at a higher quality level   and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments take longer, and both quality and motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust respect human rights, reject child labour and forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive working conditions can damage a company s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers in online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM s success.

We also base our \\nactions  on  agreements  that  include  the  Universal  Declara-\\ntion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the \\ninternational labour standards set by the International Labour \\nOrganisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created  new work zones  serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders.

Health and safety\\n\\nWork absences can result in financial damages, the loss of \\nknow-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health \\nand injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-\\nical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-\\nistent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased \\nsickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are \\nassociated with health and injury risks, among others through \\nsevere or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-\\native effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-\\nistrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal \\nconsequences for the employer. \\n\\nOur  business  success  is  based  to  a  significant  degree  on \\nthe  commitment  and  motivation  of  our  employees. As  an \\nemployer,  we  also  feel  responsible  for  their  physical  and \\npsychological health. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n  Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level   \\n\\ngoal: zero work accidents \\n\\n  Protect and promote employees  health\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, support for employees  physical \\nand psychological health in everyday office routines plays a \\ncentral role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-\\npational  physician,  in-house  fitness  rooms).  A  major  focal \\npoint  for  construction  sites  involves  occupational  safety \\nmeasures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection \\nincluding training).\\n\\nUBM has implemented an integrated management system to \\nsupport occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-\\nees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe success of these measures is reflected in the number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees  health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms. Outdoor athletes can join the  UBM-Express  and \\ntake part in various running events. An occupational physi-\\ncian is also available to assist employees at UBM s Vienna \\nlocation.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur many years of experience as a real estate developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and  GNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n  Accessibility\\n  Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n  Indoor climate and acoustics\\n  Security \\n  Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification     through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends   as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.

Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept   for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas well as sustainable mobility concepts (car/bike sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation. The following offering is \\ndesigned to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-\\ntally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-\\ning users:\\n\\n  E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for \\n\\ne-bike batteries \\n\\n  Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle\\n  E-bike hire stations\\n  Additional bicycle storage areas\\n  Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers \\n\\nand changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair \\npoint \\n\\nSome  of  these  services,  for  example  car  sharing  and  the \\ne-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in \\nthe neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower   which creates excellent and \\nefficient synergies for both buildings.\\n\\nAt the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be \\nable to use e-charging stations in the office and residential \\nareas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing \\nproducts.   \\n\\nThe Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, \\nis  currently  carrying  out  a   manage  to  green   project  that \\ninvolves  the  refitting  of  two  buildings  to  include  parking \\nspaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, \\ne-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking \\nspaces in the business park.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n5.6.  Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness of sustainability issues can also improve users  sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens  initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nH fe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject     and  for  all  other  UBM  developments     is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens  concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone   an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n  is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and \\nshared activities, the use of a quarter management app is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases and improves the value of the area surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

Corporate governance & compliance \\n\\n6.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years   also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard ( Sustainable Corporate Governance ) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.

We have implemented the following measures to support \\nthis approach and anchor these principles in our company.\\n\\nThere were no confirmed cases of corruption, proven money \\nlaundering incidents or other violations of rules and regu-\\nlations that would have led to fines or non-monetary sanc-\\ntions in 2021 or 2020. Furthermore, there were no confirmed \\ncases where contracts with business partners were cancelled \\nor not extended due to violations involving corruption, and \\nno confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of \\nemployees due to corruption. There were no proceedings \\nfor anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-\\nination incidents.  \\n\\nWhistleblower system\\nThe whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover \\nviolations of data protection regulations and other report-\\nable incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. \\nIt will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports \\nin connection with UBM s ethics code and made available in \\nCzech and Polish.\\n\\n99\\n\\nQuality management system\\nISO  9001  certification  is  intended  to  make  sure  the  pro-\\ncess-oriented quality management system is based on the \\nhighest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG \\nand UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-\\ntified  under  the  international  quality  management  norm  \\nISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-\\ntification covered 62% of UBM s workforce in 2021.\\n\\nRemuneration model\\nThe possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model \\nwill be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in \\nmanagement s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\n\\nImplement guidelines and prevent misconduct by \\nconsequent preventive activities\\nEmployee training  \\nThe goal of training is to create a greater awareness among \\nemployees  for  potential  sources  of  risk  and,  in  this  way, \\nprevent  corruption  and  anti-competitive  behaviour.  New \\nemployees  receive  training  from  the  compliance  depart-\\nment immediately after they join UBM. Regular e-learning \\nprogrammes cover compliance with guidelines on different \\nsubjects  like  the  anti-corruption  guideline  and  the  guide-\\nline on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to \\nensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, \\nand the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-\\npliance guideline to prevent market abuse.\\n\\nMost of the classroom training on compliance regulations \\nhas been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 \\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 174 employee \\ntraining courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance \\nissues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money \\nlaundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were \\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##reworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case \\nexamples.  \\n\\nThe compliance team frequently visits training courses, and \\nthere are additional certifications for selected responsibilities \\n(for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified \\nas a compliance officer under ISO 19600).\\n\\nThe  procedure  for  the  distribution  of  relevant  corporate \\nguidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-\\nees  will  be  notified  separately  of  any  relevant  changes  in \\nexisting guidelines.\\n\\nEthics code\\nThe ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees \\nin their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet \\nour sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-\\ngration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, \\nthe focus on human rights and environmental protection was \\nreinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG \\nis also supported by company events and training (like the \\nClimate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the \\ngreen. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal \\ncommunication.\\n\\nSampling controls of insider information\\nThe compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-\\nitor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider \\ninformation and confidential and price-sensitive information. \\nAdditional clarification briefings are held if necessary.\\n\\nPrevent money laundering and terrorism financing\\nKYC review of new business partners\\nKnow your customer is one of the basic principles underly-\\ning the guideline for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing and the work instructions on money \\nlaundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries and contracts with politically exposed persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities. The related activities are classified \\ninternationally as having an increased risk of money launder-\\ning, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated \\nregularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing. \\n\\nThe  risk  analysis  for  all  Austrian  subsidiaries  which  have \\nregistered brokerage as one of their commercial activities \\nwas updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the \\nrespective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement &  \\n\\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays  Think global, order local . Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the one hand, local companies are supported and, on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving timber construction. UBM created jobs and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-\\nscored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification \\nof most of our commercial projects   including residential \\nconstruction in the future   based on recognised sustainability \\nseals like DNGB,  GNI, LEED or BREEAM.\\n\\nThe green. smart. and more. initiative\\nIn line with the above-mentioned management approach, \\nthe green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. \\nIt is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that \\ncovered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The \\nfocus was placed on the following seven core issues which \\nwere defined in a dialogue between the Management Board \\nand Executive Committee:\\n\\nThese certifications also involve external experts and auditors \\nto confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. \\nMinimising the environmental impact of a building during its \\nentire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating \\nenergy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning \\nstage. The economic dimension covers the construction costs \\nas well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire \\nusage period or lifetime of the building.

Innovation & technologies  \\n\\nInternal and external research activities and innovations for \\nsustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value \\nchain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are \\nconsidered. The use of smart building technology (e.g. sen-\\nsors for smart ventilation, intelligent shading), for example, \\ncan make an important contribution to energy savings and \\nefficiency improvements and, in this way, reduce the negative \\nimpact on people and the environment.

These activities \\nare focused on the following:\\n\\nIdeas and concepts were developed for these core areas as \\nanswers to the challenges created by climate change. The \\nprevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building \\nmaterials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-\\ngration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-\\nwords.

In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards   Core \\nOption .\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with   267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021.

The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment, because UBM is unable to control the related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe indicators in the section on the environment cover all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021.

These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-\\npendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a \\nlimited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.  \\n\\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract \\n(AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors (https://www.ksw.or.at/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-\\n209/), which also apply towards third parties.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-GrtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signicance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG it stands for the S in Environment, Social and , this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed just underscored the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBMs green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also reected in the focus on green building, green nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also conrm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signicance of ESG for UBM also and especially in times like would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22 ##PAGE_BREAK##5 ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E Our strategy can be summarised in four words: green. smart. and more.

Because anyone who plans for the future must develop buildings that are sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically appealing, where people feel well. now the determining factors for our actions. In 2021 UBM applied for membership of the UN Global Compact, com-mitted to compliance with the UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals, and became an ofcial supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We develop properties for Europes major cities. In line with our core strategy, the focus is on green building and smart ofce in metropolises like Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and Prague. With over 150 years of experience, UBM provides a full range of development services from planning to marketing from a single source. Ecological and social aspects play an important role in every decision because our actions today design the working and living space of tomorrow. Gold from EcoVadis, Prime Status from ISS ESG and more than 30 green building cer-tications in recent years underscore UBMs commitment to sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic signicantly increased the pace of change in this area. Ecological and social sustainability are UBM Development AG is listed in the prime market seg-ment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and, as a result, meets the highest transparency standards. That not only means nancial transparency but also covers the disclosure of all other aspects of the business model. UBMs corporate headquarters are located in Vienna, but its activities cover more than a dozen cities and metropoli-tan regions in ve countries Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands. In many of these markets, UBM has been active as a real estate developer for many decades and has proven to be a reliable partner not only for its customers, but also for the public authori-ties and nancing banks. 2-1, 2-6 T E A M P E R F O R M A N C E A L O N G T H E E N T I R E V A L U E C H A I N Planning and engineering Project management Financing Legal Marketing 8 ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E Properties for Europes metropolises.

It is a conviction that is also reflected in our green. smart. and more. strategy. 1.2. Our activities UBM develops and sells real estate at top locations with added value potential. That is our DNA. With forward sales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling a property before completion means minimising the risk and setting a value for the sale which can be included in our accounting on a proportional basis during the con-struction period. Real estate development is our core expertise. This strategy guarantees a balance between protability and risk. UBMs investments are concentrated in markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, generate optimal added value for our investors over the medium to long term. UBM acts as a one-stop shop. We offer all necessary ser-vices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-ment, planning and project management, nancing, rental and sale. We can rely on a team of specialists with many years of professional experience who can accompany pro-cesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant or nal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover all stages of the real estate value chain in our own house. UBMs core business is real estate development with a focus on the residential and ofce asset classes. Over 450 apartments were sold in 2021. Based on the Total Output recorded in the individual countries during the past year, Germany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland for 17% and the other markets for 7%. The development pipeline in UBMs core markets is also well-lled for the future with 2.2bn by 2025. Our development projects are clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The ofce segment covers 45%. The German-speaking coun- tries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of our projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed by the Czech Republic (7%) and other countries (2%). The focal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in top cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna. For historical reasons, UBM holds properties with a total value of roughly 300m in its standing investment portfo-lio. These properties represent investments where the com-pany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, or properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other reasons. UBMs basic strategic focus, however, is that of a Pure Play Developer. Nearly 75% of the companys book value is attributable to development. 2-6 U B M C O R E C O M P E T E N C E sell with added value develop 10 buy ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E T H E V A L U E C H A I N Acquisition Zoning / building rights S N A T I O Asset management R E P O Sale / exit C O N C E Planning P T I O N Rental / marketing C O Construction Financing Approvals N O I T A S I L A E R N S T R UCTION 1.3. Competence and consequence along the value chain Competence along the entire value chain is also part of UBMs DNA, whereby sustainability is a central aspect. Because every decision we make in connection with the development of a property has an impact on the global climate for the coming decades. A conviction that is also reected in our green. smart. and more. strategy. The rst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for and evaluation of a location, followed by building permit and zoning issues. The next step is the development and planning stage. After the necessary approvals are received and the nancing is secured, construction begins. General contractors, individual companies or a combination of both serve as UBMs partners. UBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales as early as the implementation phase. Due to UBMs strate-gic transformation into a Pure Play Developer, the proper- ties are generally sold. The company also holds individual standing assets in its portfolio (31% of the total property carrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-ble for asset management. In line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-cycle of a property is evaluated for example: possibilities for the later use of a building through refurbishment or the recyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be actively included in the planning phase. Quality and experience along the value chain As a Pure Play Developer, UBM works with a wide variety of service providers and suppliers. The main service pro-viders are consultants, for example architects, building physicists, appraisers and structural engineering in other words, representatives of the different elds required for 11 ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E planning. The transfer of a project to realisation involves new partners: either a general contractor, individual com-panies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers are organised for various management duties after comple-tion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business partners, UBM places the highest priority on experience from earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-ate qualications. There were no signicant changes in the supply chain during 2021. 2-6 1.4. International presence and stable shareholder structure UBM Development and its subsidiaries have an efcient local network which guarantees competitive positioning in the individual markets. In addition to the headquarters of UBM Development AG in Vienna, the following operating subsidiaries are active in real estate development: (cid:132) UBM Development Deutschland GmbH and Alba Bau Projekt Management GmbH (Germany) (cid:132) UBM Development sterreich GmbH (Austria) (cid:132) UBM Development Czechia s.r.o. (Czech Republic) (cid:132) UBM Development Polska sp.z o.o. (Poland) (cid:132) UBM Development Netherlands B.V. (Netherlands) There were no signicant changes in the organisation dur-ing 2021. The share capital of UBM Development AG totalled 22,416,540 as of 31 December 2021 and is divided into 7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising the IGO-Ortner Group and the Strauss Group held an unchanged 38.8% of the shares outstanding at year-end 2021. In addition, the IGO-Ortner Group held 6.8% of UBM outside the syndi-cate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a pri-vate investor. Free oat comprised 49.4% of the shares and included the 3.9% of the shares held by the Management and Supervisory Boards. Most of the other free oat was held by investors in Austria (53%) and Germany (32%). 2-1, 2-2, 2-9 1.5. Teamwork, also at the top Cooperation is not only a guiding principle for UBM, but also a quality valued by top management. The four-mem-ber Management Board Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin Lcker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO) and Martina Maly-Grtner (COO) is supported by the Executive Committee as an extended management body. The Executive Committee includes the four Management Board members and, at the present time, 16 selected coun-try and specialist managers. The committee meets six to eight times each year to evaluate market trends and ensure continuous calibration. The members of the Executive Com-mittee, in total, have invested approximately 5m in UBM shares and participate at 5% in an increase in the companys value through stock options. Sustainability is an issue for management. But not only. The assignment of responsibilities proves that sustain- ability plays a central role at UBM: Sustainability is a matter for management. The Management Board is responsible for the organisation of and compliance with sustainability issues. Thomas G. Winkler, the Chief Executive Ofcer, is in charge of the sustainability-relevant areas of strategy, investor relations & ESG, and compliance. Green build-ing and timber construction report to Martin Lcker, while Patric Thate makes sure the nancing turns green and oversees the implementation of ESG data management. Employees & work safety as well as hotel operations are the responsibility of Martina Maly-Grtner. The Executive Committee regularly deals with sustainability issues, espe-cially in view of the new strategic focus on green. smart. and more. UBM became one of the rst listed companies in Austria to establish an ESG Committee for the Supervisory Board in February 2021. As the senior controlling body, the Super-visory Board is now able to meet its responsibilities for the environment, society and governance through a separate committee. The ESG Committee deals with the analysis of sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts in corporate processes in particular, it denes the most 12 ##PAGE_BREAK##important ESG factors that are deter-mined by the companys sector afliation and business model and are subject to regional inuence. The ESG Committee monitors and sup-ports activities in line with the ESG cat-alogue of measures based on the clear assignment of responsibilities at Man-agement Board and Supervisory Board levels. It also supervises and evaluates the implemented ESG measures above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, the use of resources, the direct and indi-rect neighbourhood, and good corpo-rate management. Additional informa-tion on the ESG Committee can be found in the Annual Report for 2021 under the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88. The inclusion of ESG factors in the remu-neration model will be analysed in detail in the future: Plans call for the integration of key ESG performance indicators in managements variable remuneration over the medium term. Further information on the Supervisory Board and Manage-ment Board is provided in the Annual Report for 2021 under the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 88. Shared values as the basis Many projects in many different countries that demands a common basis to make sure everyone pulls together. At UBM, this means a clear strategic focus and shared values. The foundation is created by a system of values that is based on three pillars: competent. consequent. transparent. Speci-cally, that means: UBM stands for high technical competence, consequent actions and full transparency. 2-9, 2-13, 2-19, 2-22 13 Martina Maly-Grtner (COO), Thomas G. Winkler (CEO), Martin Lcker (COO), Patric Thate (CFO), f.l.t.r. Based on these dened values, we have formulated the following binding goals: one goal stands for an increase in the value of the company. one team expresses the goal to grow even closer together as a corporate group. one company reects the clear understanding to deal with the outside world as a single entity. ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E 1.6. Financial performance indicators Business development and earnings With after-tax prot of 44m, UBM closed the 2021 nan-cial year with results that exceeded expectations at the start of the second pandemic year. This performance was supported by the selected sale of projects, without being involved in their realisation. The consequent focus on green. smart. and more. also played an important role. However, successful strategic change not only requires a solid nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever before with an equity ratio of 37%. This improvement was based primarily on property sales in Germany and Austria as well as the progress of con-struction on previously sold real estate projects which are recognised over time in accordance with the progress of completion and sale. The prot from companies accounted for at equity rose to 36.0m in 2021 (2020: 27.8m). This improvement was supported, above all, by ongoing forward sold real estate projects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt. UBM Development generated Total Output of 471.0m in 2021, compared with 478.6m in the previous year. Of this total, 371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The largest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-many and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the pre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output for the reporting year was also inuenced, above all, by the progress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-jects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-centage of completion and realisation. In this category, the largest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-tial construction projects like the Gmunder Hfe in Munich and the Siebenbrunnengasse in Vienna, a project with 178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-itive contributions were made by the forward sold F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. EBITDA rose by 10.8m over the previous year to 75.9m in 2021. Depreciation and amortisation declined by 14.8% to 2.6m (2020: 3.1m), and EBIT consequently rose by 11.3m to 73.3m (2020: 62.0m). Financial income declined from 23.9m in the previous year to 14.0m, and nancial costs amounted to 27.2m (2020: 23.7m). There were no material deviations in nancial costs during 2021 or 2020. EBT totalled 60.1m in 2021 and was 2.1m, or 3.4%, lower than the previous year (2020: 62.3m). Tax expense equalled 16.4m, compared with 21.5m in 2020, and represented a tax rate of 27.3% (2020: 34.5%). The lower tax rate in the reporting year resulted from the tax effects of equity-accounted results and a special effect from the sale of a project in Austria. Revenue as reported on the consolidated income state-ment increased by 51.8% to 278.3m (2020: 183.3m). Prot for the period (net prot after tax) totalled 43.7m in 2021 (2020: 40.8m). Net prot attributable to the 14 14 ##PAGE_BREAK##U B M A T A G L A N C E shareholders of the parent company amounted to 33.6m for the reporting year (2020: 32.8m). Beginning with the 2020 nancial year, the calculation of net prot attribut-able to the shareholders of the parent company includes a deduction for the share attributable to the hybrid capi-tal holders; the comparative prior year data were adjusted accordingly. The share attributable to the hybrid capital holders rose from 7.0m to 8.6m in the 2021 nancial year following the issue of a new hybrid bond during the second quarter of 2021. The resulting earnings per share rose from 4.39 to 4.50 in 2021. Asset and nancial position Total assets recorded by the UBM Group rose by 122.4m over the previous year to 1,494.5m as of 31 December 2021. This increase was supported, above all, by the issue of two sustainability-linked corporate bonds which will provide added nancial exibility for business activities. Non-current assets declined slightly by 0.3m to 824.6m at year-end 2021. Property, plant and equipment totalled 12.9m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 11.6m). This position consists primarily of capitalised rights of use from leases, which totalled 8.8m at the end of 2021. Current assets rose by 122.8m over the level at year-end 2020 to 669.8m as of 31 December 2021. This increase was based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash receivables, which grew by 176.1m to 423.3m. Equity totalled 550.6m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 482.9m) and was increased primarily by the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity ratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above the upper end of the 3035% target range (31 December 2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-ability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was nalised during the second quarter of the reporting year. Nearly 50% of the 2018 hybrid bond was redeemed prematurely, and this nancing was extended to 2026. Bond liabilities totalled 526.5m at the end of December 2021 and were 70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-vious year (31 December 2020: 456.5m). A 7.0m bearer bond (term ) and a further 0.5m bearer bond (term ) were issued in the rst quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, UBM issued a sustain- ability-linked bond (term: ). The issue volume of 150.0m included 68.9m from the exchange of the exist-ing bond . A promissory note loan and bearer bond (term: ) were repaid in December 2021. Net debt was substantially lower than the previous year at 381.0m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 479.1m). This indicator represents current and non-cur-rent bonds and nancial liabilities, excluding lease liabil-ities, less cash and cash equivalents. The decline in net debt resulted, above all, from distributions from equity- accounted companies, property sales and an increase in nancial liabilities as support for investments. 2-6 15 15 15 ##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAIL16 ##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAILESG which stands for Environment, Social, Governance is an integral part of our strategy.

Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy.

By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community live. In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the rst time as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the Caritas am Himmel during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area.

A number of inuential players have established a position as intermediaries between ESG requirements and the cap-ital market. In addition to shareholders and banks, rating agencies, analysts and international institutional investors are becoming more and more important. One key example is the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which has dened binding global guidelines for the preparation of sustain-ability reports. UBM, as an international company, already reports in accordance with the latest GRI standards to pro-vide decision-makers with comparable information and understandable performance indicators. Clear criteria and responsibilities The ESG Committee has wide-ranging responsibilities. It analyses sustainability criteria and corporate social respon-sibility concepts in corporate processes and denes the most important ESG factors based on industry afliation, business model and regional inuences. The committee also claries responsibilities at Management Board and Supervisory Board levels. It monitors and evaluates the ESG measures set by UBM and, for example, regularly exam-ines and documents the effects of employment and devel-opment processes. An ESG Committee at the highest level ESG issues deserve the greatest possible attention. At UBM, that means they are an issue for the boss. For exam-ple: the ESG reporting by the UBM Management Board to the Supervisory Board goes far beyond standard informa-tion. An ESG Committee was established especially for this purpose and is comparable to the Audit Committee that reviews UBMs nancial reporting. The integrity of our customers is regularly reviewed with a so-called KYC (Know Your Customer) check. Routine train-ing courses are also held on the prevention of money laun-dering. Compliance in other words, the observance of legally required standards, especially on the capital market is given great attention.

With the announcement of the Green Deal, the European Union under-scored its intention to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in the world by 2050. Other megatrends apart from ecology are urbanisation and the demographic and social shifts in the social order. Silver Society describes the age-ing of society, in which health and the quality of life will be deeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. Changing gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes have also led to radical changes in society and the business sector. These developments, together with COVID-19, are the decisive factors for the megatrend New Work meaning peoples needs as regards their working world. We see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity: The interaction with ESG is a key success factor for our entrepreneurial actions. In the sense of ecological sustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading tim-ber construction developers in Europe. Our actions today are already focused on smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flex-ible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrows users. As a real estate developer, we can give the office a new standing as a communication and collaboration plat-form the physical workplace then becomes a place for community and corporate culture. As an employer, we also take advantage of these opportunities for example, by benefitting from the additional innovation potential created by a diverse workforce. UBM has anchored the relevance of ESG in its corporate strategy through the focus on green. smart. and more. and is introducing concrete measures. The efficient use of resources is an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues and adherence to compliance rules.

Green building and timber construc-tion report to Martin Lcker, while Patric Thate makes sure the financing turns green and reliable ESG data management becomes reality. Employees and work safety are the respon-sibility of Martina Maly-Grtner. The Management Board and Executive Committee, together with the heads of the involved specialist departments, are responsible for the implementation of ESG activities. The rel-evance of the sustainability strategy and goals is evaluated at regular intervals and suitable goal attainment measures are defined. The Executive Committee frequently deals with sustainability issues, especially in view of the new strategic focus on green. smart. and more. The Management Board is included in central decisions and receives routine reports on progress. With the help of a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), the roles and responsibilities for ESG were transparently defined and recorded. The investor rela-tions & ESG department coordinates sustainability issues within the framework of UBMs strategy and business model and is in charge of the operative ESG reporting together with the organisation of ESG ratings. Its activities include the further development of the sustainability strategy, the defi-nition and monitoring of goals, and the implementation of measures together with selected specialist departments. This department is also responsible for monitoring changes in the legal framework and serves as an information interface for the company. The head of investor relations & ESG and the Management Board communicate regularly on current developments and issues. The specialist departments and countries are responsible for managing and implementing sustainability issues. These employees become involved and implement the defined measures as part of their regular day-to-day operations and in pilot projects. Corporate governance The UBM Supervisory Board is composed of members elected by the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Works Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Aus-trian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number of members to the Supervisory Board. The Annual General Meeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the end of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple majority of the votes cast. The Supervisory Board elects a chairman and one or more deputies from among its mem-bers each year at a meeting held after the Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board can form committees from among its members, which can be established as permanent bodies or for individual tasks. In 2021, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members designated by the Works Council as employee representa-tives.

In accordance with the crite-ria based on C-Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the following Supervisory Board members have declared themselves as independent: Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), Birgit Wagner, Ludwig Steinbauer, Bern-hard Vanas and Susanne Weiss. In accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Cor-porate Governance, the Supervisory Board also conducted a self-evaluation during 2021. The questionnaire used for the evaluation addressed, in particular, the efficiency of the Supervisory Board, its organisation and its working proce-dures. The findings were evaluated and discussed by the Supervisory Board. To support and ensure the efficient handling of complex issues, the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee were established in 2021. Addi-tionally, UBM became one of the first listed companies in Austria to establish an ESG committee at Supervisory Board level. The Supervisory Board, as the senior controlling body, now meets its responsibilities for the environment, society and governance through a separate committee. The members of the ESG Committee and their positions are listed in the following table. The chairperson was elected by the committee members and reports each year to the Annual General Meeting on the major ESG factors and measures. Members of the ESG Committee Name Iris Ortner Susanne Weiss Birgit Wagner Anke Duchow Position Chairwoman Deputy Chairwoman Member Member environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) that are determined by the companys sector affiliation and business model and subject to regional influence. The ESG Committee is responsible for overseeing and sup-porting actions in line with the ESG catalogue of measures based on the clear assignment of responsibilities at Manage-ment Board and Supervisory Board levels. It also monitors and evaluates the implemented ESG measures above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, the use of resources, the direct and indirect neighbourhood, and good corporate management. The integration of ESG in the remuneration model will be analysed in detail: ESG key performance indicators will be integrated in managements variable remuneration over the medium term. The remuneration for the members of the UBM Management Board implements the remuneration policy in accordance with legal regulations and consists of non-performance-re-lated components (fixed salary, pension fund/employee welfare fund contributions), performance-related compo-nents (variable performance bonus) and one-off payments as well as severance compensation for departing members. The variable, performance-based remuneration components are designed to reflect shareholders interests in the positive development of the company and increase the Management Boards motivation to take actions which lead to the sustaina-ble, long-term and risk-aware optimisation of Group results. Annual variable remuneration is dependent on the attain-ment of parameters set by the Supervisory Board, which are based on financial or non-financial criteria or a combination of both. The fixed salary of each Management Board member is based on the scope of duties as defined in the plan for the assignment of corporate responsibilities. Any side-line activ-ities by Management Board members require the approval of the Supervisory Board. The activities of the ESG Committee include the analysis of sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts in corporate processes in particular, identifying the key The variable performance bonus for the chairman of the Management Board equals 2.5 % of EBT, up to a maximum of 360,000.00 gross per year. If annual earnings equal or 42 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##exceed the amount defined by the Remuneration Commit-tee, the chairman of the Management Board is entitled to the maximum amount of the variable performance bonus. If earnings are lower than the defined target, the chairman is entitled to receive a proportional amount. Management Board members Martin Lcker and Patric Thate also receive a variable performance bonus in line with the above scheme, but each up to a maximal of 240,000.00 gross per year. In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Annual General Meeting of UBM Development AG on 28 May 2020, the following additional performance bonuses were approved for the 2021 financial year: Martin Lcker received 20,000.00 for the realisation of the Timber Pioneer project in Frankfurt and Patric Thate received 40,000.00 for activ-ities connected with the sustainability-linked bond. Annual payments are made to a pension fund for individual Man-agement Board members. The amount of the contribution is based on the members age and length of service with the company. D&O liability insurance has been contracted to cover the members of the Management Board, whereby the costs are carried by the company. Furthermore, UBM intro-duced a stock option programme for key managers and the Management Board in 2017. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the follow-ing duties in connection with the current remuneration policy and in accordance with applicable legal regulations: (i) mat-ters related to the remuneration of the Management Board members and the content of the employment contracts with these persons, in particular, the definition and implementa-tion of the underlying principles for the remuneration of the Management Board members and the criteria for the variable remuneration components in line with Rules 27 (above all, the preparation of a catalogue for the variable remunera-tion components), 27a and 28 of the Austrian Code of Cor-porate Governance; (ii) evaluating the remuneration policy for the Management Board members at regular intervals; (iii) approving the assumption of side-line activities by the Management Board members. The Remuneration Committee held two meetings during the reporting year. Consultations at the meeting on 26 March 2021 included the determination of the annual bonus for the members of the Management Board. At the meeting on 24 June 2021, the granting of a special bonus to Management Board members Patric Thate and Martin Lcker was discussed. The members of the Remu-neration Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss, FRICS (Chairman), Iris Ortner and Susanne Weiss (remuneration expert). Each Supervisory Board member receives an annual pay-ment for his or her services as well as reimbursement of expenses and an attendance fee for each meeting. The amount of the attendance fee and the annual payment are determined by the Annual General Meeting. A resolution by the Annual General Meeting on 29 May 2019 established the following remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board: the chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed remuneration of 50,000.00 per year, the deputy chairman of the Supervisory Board fixed remuneration of 40,000.00 per year and the other members fixed remuneration of 30,000.00 per year. The attendance fee for meetings was set at 2,000.00 per meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees. The Supervisory Board members appointed by the Works Council in accordance with Section 110 Para. 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act do not receive any additional payment for their work on the Supervisory Board.

This is how we include stakeholders Regular contact with our internal and external stakeholders and their active inclusion in our business activities are an essential part of what we do above all, because we have an influence on many areas of life as a project developer. The fulfilment of our social and ecological responsibility as well as UBMs long-term economic success is based on success-ful cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholders and the respectful handling of their concerns. In this connection, we carried out another materiality analysis in the business year 2021. A structured, methodical process allowed external stakeholders to contribute their views and express their concerns. Roughly 700 women and men from 12 pre-defined stakeholder groups (see page 44) were invited 43 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##to take part in an online survey 208 evaluable results were received and integrated into the materiality analysis. Based on the responses from these stakeholder groups, the major issues were identified, structured and evaluated. The results are presented in the form of a materiality matrix (see section 3.4.). S T A K E H O L D E R G R O U P S S U R V E Y E D We also include significant stakeholder groups through early information, participation and co-determination in planning and development processes, which gives neighbouring resi-dents an opportunity to explain their needs and interests and influence results. This practice has been embedded in the process landscape as UBMs standard since 2021. Additional information can be found in section 5.

Gross risks were evaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-bility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. Relevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder perspective Internal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-holder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an online survey where they were asked to rank the individual issues according to their priority and to select the five most important issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders and generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return rate of 33 %). The three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-ment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-tance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on the environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-ment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas of environment, society and governance, the findings were discussed and three material issues were identified: Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions Attractive employer & training and education Corporate governance and compliance 3.4. Materiality analysis To meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-ment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate social and ecological developments. This process is based on the concept of double materiality, meaning an evalua-tion from the outside-in (risks from the companys viewpoint, impact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-spective (UBMs impact on people and the environment). A third dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder groups. The major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part of a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. This revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-national regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft (2021) and the GRI update 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis for this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. The first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material issues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on megatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions with internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and impact of these issues followed three perspectives: UBMs impact on people, society and the environment The impact of sustainability issues on UBM The relevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder perspective UBMs impact on people, society and the environment Based on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impact on people, society and the environment were carried out together with external experts. The ecological assessments are based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and other indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of the ecological impact. The social assessments are based on an estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the impact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility of the impact. 46 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK## Water consumption and waste were combined under water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building operations. The new issue sustainable procurement and regional added value covers social criteria in the supply chain, ecological criteria in the supply chain and regional economy & society. Infrastructure and mobility, which was previously included under socio-cultural environment of projects, was recorded separately. The former issue cooperations is still an integral part of UBMs activities but is not reported as a separate entity. GRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2 The results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line with the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-ment, society and governance for sustainability reporting. Here, employees and society are covered under the same heading. The matrix shows all three dimensions and is ori-ented on the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft as well as the GRI standards 2021. The three material issues for UBM are described in detail in the following sections, and the other issues are also explained. There were a number of changes in comparison with the materiality analysis from 2020: Energy consumption and GHG (greenhouse gases) were combined under the material issue energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions. Fair working conditions and employee training and education were assigned to the material issue attractive employer & training and education. Ethics & compliance was renamed corporate governance and compliance and identified as a material issue. Users well-being and incentives for environmentally friendly behaviour were split off into customer orientation and creating awareness and healthy building materials and quality of life. Digitalisation and technology was expanded to include innovation (innovation and technologies). Adaptation to climate change and biodiversity were combined into a single issue (ground sealing, adaptation to climate change and biodiversity). Urban quarter development and socio-cultural environment of projects were combined under architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity. 47 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##M A T E R I A L I T Y M A T R I X i h g h y r e v Material in the sense of GRI and CSRD are dark green squares and topics with beige background.

Concrete goals and measures 3.5.1. Sustainable Development Goals UBM is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by all UN members in 2015 as the 2030 Agenda for Sustaina-ble Development. Governments as well as companies are called upon to make a contribution to reaching these goals. The framework includes 17 goals and 169 sub-goals which are related to global economic, social and ecological chal-lenges. Our actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. The assignment of the applicable SDGs and their sub-goals together with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and their relation to the GRI Standard is explained in greater detail in the GRI Index (see section 7). In connection with a materiality analysis (see section 3.4.) and a risk/impact assessment (see section 3.6.), UBM dealt with the SDGs and the related sub-goals in detail and iden-tified the goals where the company can make a direct con-tribution to the Agenda 2030: Climate action Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Focus: Goals 13.1 and 13.2 Life on land Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Conscious handling of risks and their effects The realistic assessment and management of risks repre-sent an essential factor for business success and sustainable management. One related step was the announcement in 2021 of UBMs commitment as an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- related risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The TCFD recommendations on the reporting of climate- related risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-ually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-agement system can be found in the annual report beginning on page 119. Governance The overall responsibility for general risk management at UBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-agement is responsible for the operational risk management process. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual risks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management Board, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-nection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively as part of the materiality analysis in 2021 and 2020 (see section 3.4.). The full Management Board was involved in this risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG department. Strategy Energy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of CO2 emissions are central drivers for UBMs long-term suc-cess and, consequently, an elementary part of the green. smart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial share of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing regulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and real estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January 2021 and deals with the energy efficiency of buildings. It requires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy buildings (according to the respective national definition). Buildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk being denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-tion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. through regulations covering primary energy requirements). That could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-sified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. The growing frequency of high temperature periods is also increasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for building operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 pricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-duced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages for fossil energy carriers. UBM has shifted its focus to the carbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies like geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building certification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings and solutions for efficient building operations are anchored in this strategy with smart. 56 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.1. Environmental risks Environmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-ingly important for the planning and realisation of develop-ment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate developers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of their activities on the environment. Economic success and sustainable project development represent an area of ten-sion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management is the basis for economic success and economic success is the basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce environmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise business opportunities for UBM in this field. A scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part of the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in greater detail in section 4. Risk management In the course of general risk management, the probability of occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the above-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the Management Board. The risk system is audited annually and adapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. Examples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are human resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee turnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings (e.g. force majeure). The risks arising from daily business operations are identified, assessed and controlled through appropriate measures by operating management. The com-pliance function monitors adherence to external and internal rules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-ent and objective monitoring. The evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis in 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The most important risks were identified with this evaluation and subsequently flowed into UBMs materiality analysis as one of the three dimensions. Metrics and targets UBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment and management along the three fields of environment, soci-ety and governance. The main goals are described on page 39, the details on page 50. Further information can be found in the following sections. Sustainable management is the basis for economic success and economic success is the basis for sustainable management. 57 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##The following environmental risks are relevant for UBM: Sustainability issues Risks Measures Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions Recyclability and durability of building materials Ground sealing, climate change adjustments and biodiversity Refurbishment and revitalisation Healthy building materials and the quality of life Water and wastewater utilisation and waste in building operations Increasing regulations for emissions, energy efficiency and other relevant topics Rising CO2 prices for fossil fuels Delivery shortages, increased competition and rising material costs Increasing regulations for building materials High water and flooding due to ground sealing Increasing temperature, heat islands Strict requirements for building demoli- tion and correct material recycling Increased minimum requirements for the healthy quality of building materials Reduced water supplies for building operations and the upstream construction industry due to dry periods (climate change) Increasing costs for waste disposal Strategic focus on timber construction, renewable energies and green building certifications Installation/Optimisation of building management systems in standing assets and at UBM locations Evaluation of timber in the selection of materials for all new development projects Include circular economy requirements in the planning stage Focus on brownfield developments Focus on biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities Expansion of biological diversity through roof and facade greening Green building certification, also for refurbishment projects Green building certification Use of timber Green building certification Established waste concepts and targeted measures for water and wastewater utilisation 58 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.2. Social risks We view our responsibility as an employer, contracting firm, business partner and integral part of our social system as a central element of our economic actions. The realisation of our projects is dependent to a significant degree on our employees. For that reason, UBM places high priority on attracting motivated, committed and qualified employees, giving them opportunities for development and creating an attractive working environment. Our success is also based on our proven quality as a business partner and contracting firm that acts with competence, reli-ability and transparency. A scenario was developed for each social issue related to sus-tainability as part of the materiality analysis. The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented meas-ures are described in greater detail in section 5. Challenges from COVID19 A taskforce comprising the Management Board, members of the Executive Committee and internal experts was established in March 2020 in reaction to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is responsible for defining the necessary dis-tancing and hygiene measures in the company and at con-struction sites to create the safest possible working conditions under the given situation in the countries with UBM locations and projects. Protecting the health and safety of all employees is this teams overriding goal. The results of this fast reaction: The active communication of measures to employees and testing offers at UBMs loca-tions and construction sites minimised the effects on UBM. Additional information on the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in the 2021 annual report beginning on page 122. 59 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##In the area of social issues, the materiality analysis identified the following risks: Sustainability issues Risks Measures EMPLOYEES Attractive employer & training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Occupational health and safety SOCIETY Architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity Higher turnover and the related additional costs, increasing costs for new hiring Decline in innovation power and productivity Image loss Loss of innovation potential when per-sonal backgrounds are not considered Lack of motivation, higher turnover and the resulting higher costs Increasing legal requirements Image loss Rising costs due to lost workdays and illness Image loss Active support for an open communica- tion culture and work-life balance Measures to develop skills and career planning, opportunities for personal development Competitive and performance-oriented remuneration and benefits Targeted recruiting of suitable female candidates Exchange of experience (buddy principle) Integrated management system for occupational safety and health protection Active support for physical and psychological health Increasing requirements for barrier-free, flexible and smart housing due to demographic shift Green building certification Active support for stakeholder dialogues Membership in initiatives like GNI, ICG Mobility and infrastructure Standing assets become more difficult Flagship projects for future-oriented or impossible to sell Customer orientation and creating awareness Project delays Market entry problems mobility concepts Active support for stakeholder dialogues Green building certification Active support for stakeholder dialogues Membership in initiatives like GNI, ICG 60 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.3. Governance risks Responsible, transparent and future-oriented management forms the basis for a companys economic success and this economic success is the basis for sustainable management. Specifically, that means: The way we address major social challenges and balanced treatment for the interests of all our stakeholders are an essential and integral part of our actions. A scenario was developed for each governance issue related to sustainability as part of the materiality analysis. The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented measures are described in greater detail in section 6. The extensive catalogue of measures to deal with compliance risks covers the entire UBM Group. Corruption risk is viewed as part of human resources risk (among others, internal fraud, corrupt behaviour) and flows into the risk assessment, risk map and overall aggregation. Measures to reduce this risk include, among others, regular training, work instructions (e.g. the dual control principle), obtaining several offers, recording order procedures, the separation of orders and payment as well as the related controls. GRI 205-1 In the area of governance, the materiality analysis identified the following risks: Sustainability issues Risks Measures Corporate governance and compliance Sustainable procurement and regional added value Fines, consequences under criminal law Reputational damage Risks for the interests of investors and employees, declining share prices Financial damages due to invalid agreements Exclusion from tenders Increasing regulatory requirements for due diligence in the supply chain Problems in international supply chains Reputational damage Commitment to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance Extensive compliance management system Whistleblower system Internal training and awareness creation Code of conduct for business partners Ethics code 360 process landscape Code of conduct for business partners Procurement guideline for the ecologically oriented purchase of office and advertising materials, meals and hospitality Innovation and technologies Impairment of competitive ability Loss of know-how Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) Digitalisation of the UBM working world 61 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##3.7. ESG reporting UBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-trian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has voluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in line with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, the company is very well prepared to address the information requirements at the product and corporate levels that will result from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. Reporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing regulatory developments for example, the materiality analy-sis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-over, UBMs reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and norms like the UN Global Compact (see section 3.9.). This ESG report serves as a progress report for the UN Global Compact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD recommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this report for the first time (see section 3.6.). In connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the coming years which were set in 2021, the ESG report is a valuable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-ity to society. The ESG report describes the management approaches, goals and measures related to the environment, society and governance, and highlights successes as well as challenges. The subject areas are based on the materiality analysis carried out in 2021. The ESG report is prepared by the investor relations & ESG department in coordination with the specialist departments and released by the Management Board. Additional information on UBM, its business devel-opment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 annual report. Transparency and reliability are also decisive for our ESG reporting, and we therefore arranged for an external lim-ited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is provided on page 125). UBM also introduced a central data management tool in 2021 which will be successively filled starting in 2022. The goal is to create an informative basis for the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. Controlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while data collection takes place directly in the respective areas and departments in the individual countries. GRI 2-3, 2-5, 2-14 3.8. ESG ratings Leading global ESG rating agencies have confirmed UBMs strong position on the topic of sustainability. ISS ESG: Prime Status for UBM Development The rating by ISS ESG resulted in Prime Status (Level C+) for UBM Development. That makes UBM Development one of the most sustainable companies in its sector in Germany and Austria. The corporate rating by ISS ESG evaluates the ecological and social performance of a company based on more than 100 selected sector-specific ecological, social and corporate gov-ernance criteria. 62 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##and sector associations. The company has been a member of the Institute for Corporate Governance (ICG) since 2019 and contributes to the ICGs social impact investment initia-tive. In addition, UBM is a member of the corporate platform respACT (Austrian Council for Sustainable Development), the Austrian Sustainable Building Council (sterreichische Gesellschaft fr Nachhaltige Immobilienwirtschaft, GNI) and Hotel Management Associates (HAMA). UBM expanded its active participation in the interest group IG-Lebenszyklus Bau to include membership in 2020. The organisations working group on the shortage of land is headed, among others, by Gerald Beck, managing director of UBM Austria. We are committed to finding ways to stop the wasteful use of the limited resource land with existing and new framework conditions. We also play an active role in the Association of Austrian Project Developers (Vereinigung der sterreichischen Pro-jektentwickler, VPE). Together with other VPE members, UBM shows that project developers can be strong and reli-able partners for the general public and the public sector in the creation of living environments. GRI 2-28 EcoVadis: Gold for UBM Development The first evaluation by the internationally recognised ESG rat-ing agency EcoVadis led to Gold for UBM Development AG. UBM now belongs to the top two per cent of the sector (real estate and housing) and the top five per cent of the 75,000 companies graded by EcoVadis. This evaluation is based on 21 criteria from the four most important sustainability aspects: environment, labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable reporting. UBMs per-formance exceeded the sector average in all four categories. 3.9. Memberships Our actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, a network of the future which UBM joined in 2021. UBM has also been an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2021, where it is one of more than 2,500 organisations com-mitted to fighting climate risks and developing a more resist-ant financial system through better disclosure. An intensive dialogue with stakeholders is guaranteed and reinforced by UBMs participation in various organisations 63 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY ##PAGE_BREAK##64 44UBM & ENVIRONMENT64 ##PAGE_BREAK##65 44UBM & ENVIRONMENT6445UBM & ENVIRONMENT4.

The real estate and construction sector is, from the global viewpoint, the most CO2-and energy-intensive area. It there-fore goes without saying that ecological aspects play a key role in all our decisions. Our focus on green building, our commitment to wood construction, and renewable energies and energy efficiency are an expression of this conviction. Future-oriented real estate development As a real estate developer, we design the living space of the future and that means we also design the environment. Real estate development is not only our core business, it also gives us the greatest leverage to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. Consequently, UBM directly addresses the ecolog- ical impact of its activities in all project phases with a con-stant focus on environmental protection and the careful use of resources. Our activities concentrate on the following areas: Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions Durability and recyclability of materials Ground sealing, climate change and biodiversity Refurbishment and revitalisation Healthy building materials and the quality of life Real estate development projects Projects Total pipeline1 GFA (Gross Floor Area) total [m] GFA Office [m] GFA Hotel [m] GFA Residential [m] GFA Other and Mix [m] Projects all asset classes [number] Office [number] Hotel [number] Residential [number] Other and Mix [number] 711,709 133,765 129,899 382,121 65,924 54 9 8 35 2 2021 118,104 5,430 51,149 47,072 14,453 10 1 4 4 1 2020 129,269 44,407 8,046 76,816 0 10 2 1 7 0 2019 70,431 2,451 39,010 28,260 710 8 1 3 3 1 1 The data covers all projects in the pipeline, including the projects completed in 2021. We measure our locations based on their footprint In addition to our development projects, we want to make our own business operations more sustainable. UBM has office space at 19 locations. Our goal in this area is to steadily reduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach this goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-tion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-agement are also important issues for UBM and are internally managed and reported. Fewer standing assets The strategic focus of UBMs business activities includes the development and sale of properties. Accordingly, the number of standing assets has been steadily reduced since 2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these properties here, the key issue is whether the properties are rented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on energy consumption and emissions, for example through the use of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling solutions. 66 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##4.1. Energy efficiency, renewable energies & CO2 emissions 4.1.1. Importance of the issue With the Paris Agreement, nations across the world have agreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially below 2C and, through further measures, to limit the increase to 1.5C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green Deal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in this context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-house gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This important interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on course to become the worlds first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Related activities include the European Commis-sions Fit for 55 package which includes draft legislation in the areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use of land and forestry operations. The requirements include, among others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-cate trading and CO2 taxes). Other sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy currently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and establish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-mate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-ments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-omy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. Various players including companies, investors, public institutions and con-sumers are called on to accept responsibility and support the attainment of these goals with effective measures. 67 These ambitious goals represent a challenge for the real estate sector because energy consumption and the related greenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their entire lifecycle have a significant influence on the climate footprint. The construction and operation of real estate are responsible for nearly 40% of global CO2 emissions and over one third of worldwide energy consumption (UNEP 2020). The real estate sector therefore plays an important role reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals. Real estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-able, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-sions: The examples of possible actions include renewable energies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic or solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase or subsequent refitting and options for the expansion of renewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells and technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-rials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts (e.g. e-charging stations). GRI 3-3 4.1.2. Our commitment Through the development of new projects, we create urgently needed living space for society. We want to support the global agenda and attach great importance to environmen-tally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-struction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be substantially reduced, both during construction and in later building operations. Our focus is on low-emission building materials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of renewable energies. Our commitment to and investments in timber construction are important because of their significant, inherent capability to reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood stores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-duction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results in CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel frequently used in building construction is responsible for no less than six per cent of all CO2 emissions worldwide. Consequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa- UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for every project. Our goal here is to create significantly more than 100,000 square metres of office and residential space in timber-hybrid construction by 2025. The energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM (offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment and is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early as the planning phase, the energy consumption from the construction and operation of a building can be reduced. Efficient measures include, among others, good insulation, energy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-tation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the energy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and cooling) with modern sensors. We are working intensively to develop smart buildings that ultimately consume less energy and resources. In comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or heating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings (geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) can make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-sions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting or options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. The options for connecting to geothermal power and similar sources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location and acquiring the site. Our green. smart. and more. strategy places ESG in the focus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply anchored in processes and represents an integral part of all phases. Processes are operationally standardised through an institutionalised 360 principle. More specifically: As part of the Next Level efficiency programme, all core and sup-port processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-ity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. These processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus on green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the strategy at project level. For example: Every project must include an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber as a building material, greening and the on-site generation of renewable energy through photovoltaics as only several examples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide processes. Additional information on the 360 process land-scape can be found in section 6. For new projects, we build with timber and operate with renewable energy wherever possible. Sustainability certifications are a suitable measurement instrument to make building performance on the real estate market comparable and to draw conclusions and learn from the results. For many years, we have actively, and based on our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our properties. All new construction projects are sustainably planned, built and subject to a sustainability assessment based on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has set a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve certification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, but also for all new projects in the residential asset class at the latest by 2025. As a pure property developer, we work with a wide range of suppliers and service providers. Our business partners are required to meet the same high standards, for example strict environmental requirements for suppliers production processes and building material components. Environmental protection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement (further information can be found in section 6). The focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations is also increasing. The corporate units in Austria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified under the international environmental management norm ISO and quality management norm ISO 9001, and UBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022. UBM Devel- 68 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##The project managers are responsible for the operational implementation of the green building strategy in develop-ment projects. They optimise the projects, e.g. for energy consumption, in cooperation with external experts in agree-ment with the possibilities offered by the respective locations. The implementation of the green building strategy in standing assets and at Group locations is the responsibility of UBMs asset managers. They implement the measures defined by green building to reduce the CO2 emissions from these properties. The timber construction department with its five experts is the competence centre for timber construction and contributes directly to UBMs strategic focus. All projects are carefully reviewed by UBMs Management Board and must be approved. GRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3 4.1.4. Goals and measures Property development Goals from our sustainability programme: Timber construction Green building certification Reduction of CO2 by 30% To reach these ambitious goals, UBM implements specifically designed measures to reduce energy consumption in its pro-jects. Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for building shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-nical equipment. The use of timber as a building material makes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. An active commitment to sustainability best practices makes it possible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to opti-mise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 emissions. opment AG and UBM Austria are also certified under the ISO energy management norm. Our binding ethics code, in which the subject of environmental protection is anchored, creates the foundation for all business activities and decisions, whereby compliance is confirmed in writing by our employees (see section 6 for further information). The United Nations recommends three steps to achieve cli-mate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, finally, compensate for unavoidable emissions. We calcu-late our emissions based on the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol and monitor and report on our performance. One challenge in this respect is the limited availability of data on Scope 3 emissions, i.e. the indirect emissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw materials and other products. In cases where there is a lack of low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates as compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising from electricity consumption in selected standing assets or Group locations. In order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM established the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022. This non-profit foundation includes partners from industry and science who work together to develop tech-nical applications for smart buildings. The foundation com-plements our green. smart. and more. strategy and will con-tribute to achieving greater sustainability in the real estate sector. Its goals include the long-term reduction of emissions and resource consumption as well as the optimisation of eco-nomic feasibility for sustainable office and residential con-cepts. The first use case deals with consumption-and capac-ity-optimised office properties. GRI 2-23, 2-25, 3-3 4.1.3. Organisational structure The green building department supports and monitors the operational implementation of green building processes. New requirements at national and European level are eval-uated and implemented at project level in agreement with the green. smart. and more. strategy. This department also coordinates the evaluation and organisation of building cer-tification for development projects by external partners. 69 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##Goals and measures in detail: Timber construction Over 100,000 m in timber construction by 2025 Evaluation of timber in the selection of materials for all new projects CO2 reduction of at least 20% with timber construction at the project level by 2025 In order to ensure the conscious selection of materials for the construction of buildings, every development project begins with the question: Can it be realised with timber construction? The lifecycle assessment for every timber construction pro-ject must demonstrate savings compared with conventional construction methods when realisation is planned. These two quality gates are part of the 360 principle described in section 4.1.2. UBM underscored its commitment to sustainable building materials in the barany.7 residential construction project in Vienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare the different construction methods under the same condi-tions. One of the seven identical buildings was built as a wood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid method. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna is accompanying the project with a study which will document the long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, practical comparison. The positive experience from this Vienna project was also transferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-ing permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-ber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build in timber-hybrid construction. This structure (construction, maintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 reduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con- struction methods. UBM is handling the embodied carbon, i.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase by using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building materials. One challenge for timber construction is the current lack of specialists in the executing companies. The strong dynamics on the timber market were a further source of uncertainty during the past year but, after a speculative phase, the timber price stabilised at a level where this raw material is available at a reasonable price. Energy & CO2 intensity Reduction of primary energy requirements to national nearly zero energy building standards by 2025 Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030 Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 50% by 2030 To meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined the primary energy requirements which flow into the plan-ning of technical building equipment in all new development projects. The installation of measurement and monitoring sys-tems (smart buildings) can lead to the target-oriented reduc-tion of emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or equipment. The durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a sec-ond or third use in the planning stage, is an important factor: The specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life Cycle Costings (LCC/lifecycle cost calculations) and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA/lifecycle evaluations). These planning tools make it possible to determine and, where necessary, to optimise the energy requirements and CO2 emissions of buildings from construction to maintenance and dismantling. 70 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##The calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is based on the final energy requirements in the respective project. The energy intensity depends on the project specifics (asset class, countries) and is therefore subject to fluctuations.

The energy consumption in the project development is calculated as per certificates. Green building certification Obtain green building certification for 100% of new developments starting in 2022 UBM expanded its sustainability strategy in 2021 to include internationally recognised certification for the residential con-struction projects that are designated for global sale. Green building certification for all new projects is a mandatory element of the 360 principle. In addition, the profiles dis- mantling and construction site were added to the certifica-tion programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project in Vienna. UBM has decided to extend its certifications to refurbishments and listed buildings in 2019, and plans call for the continuation of this strategy. The following projects were successfully completed in 2021: anders wohnen, Munich-Pasing barany.7, Vienna Pohlgasse, Vienna Neugraf, Prague Astrid Office, Prague voco, The Hague Mercure, Katowice Holiday Inn Express, Dsseldorf ibis Styles, Krakow Am Kanal, Potsdam The residential and hotel asset classes comprised a major part of the projects finalised by UBM in 2021. Four projects in each of these two classes, with 47,072 m (residential) and 51,149 m (hotels) of GFA were completed, each represent-ing 40% of the total completions. Six of the ten projects completed in 2021, representing 100% of the commercial properties, successfully completed a sus-tainability assessment. In total, 71,032 m of the 118,104m GFA completed in that year, or 60%, were certified. The four uncertified projects are residential projects which were started before UBMs strategic reorientation, and certification was therefore not carried out. UBM plans to continue building certification as confirmation of the sustainability of its property developments. All projects in all asset classes in the pipeline will undergo a sustainabil-ity assessment in the future to support the attainment of the defined goals over the long term. Building certification will also be used as a tool to implement the requirements of the EU Taxonomy in established systems. 71 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##The following table shows the classification of certified and uncertified projects: Certifications real estate development Projects all asset classes [number] Office [number] Hotel [number] Residential [number] Other and Mix [number] GFA total [m] GFA certified [%] GFA certified [m] GFA not certified [m] Certifications1 [number] DGNB [number] LEED [number] BREEAM [number] 2021 2020 2019 10 1 4 4 1 118,104 60 71,032 47,072 6 2 3 1 10 2 1 7 0 129,269 41 52,453 76,816 3 3 0 0 8 1 3 3 1 70,431 55 39,010 31,420 4 3 3 0 1 The data are based on the absolute number of projects, without an adjustment for double certification.

Vehicles Double the number of vehicles with alternative drives by 2025 (basis 2021) Records have been kept on the petrol and diesel consump-tion of all Group motor vehicles since 2020. These surveys provide the basis for defining concrete targets to reduce emissions. Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles when new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also involves the availability of suitable charging stations near the employees home. In 2021, UBMs motor vehicle pool had 18 vehicles with alternative drives. Travel Reduce CO2 in air travel by 25% (basis 2019) by 2025 The Group-wide travel guideline think before you travel makes clear that business trips should only be taken when absolutely necessary. Rail travel must be given preference for shorter distances, and video conference portals should be used more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital formats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria travelled to Vienna to experience our Groups commu-nity live. This event was certified as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements including environmentally friendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A limited number of the participants travelled via air due to the longer distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-ing emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support for the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. To meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting its Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-ping or refitting these facilities with building management systems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in this area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share of renewable energy in UBMs total energy consumption in 2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, 15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates were purchased for the Groups location in Warsaw due to the lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the emissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with the GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not have an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all locations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland will be converted to green electricity, where available, at the latest in 2025. UBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-plies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-works and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-gy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations are renovated. UBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-ciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-ments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development projects) and locations are covered by these procedures. An external energy audit was carried out at the German and Austrian locations in 2019, and verification audits based on ISO took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) during 2020 and 2001. ISO audits are scheduled for Germany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will follow. An important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will be expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more exact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-sions. This will support the development of further climate protection initiatives in the future. Transparent data collection is already in place at most of the locations, and projects have 73 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##Standing assets Goal from our sustainability programme: 4.2. Recyclability & durability of building materials Increase in renewable energy Goals and measures in detail: Renewable energy Increase the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 30% by 2025 UBM is converting not only its Group locations but also its standing assets to green electricity suppliers. The W3, a stand-ing asset in Vienna, already purchases green electricity and, in addition to district heating, is also changing over to district cooling. A manage to green project is currently in progress at the Poleczki Business Park in Poland. It involves the neutral-isation of CO2 emissions from the total electricity consump-tion in 2021 and 2022 through certificates because green electricity is not available at that location. In order to ensure the long-term availability of renewable energy, photovoltaic equipment is currently being installed on the rooftop of one of the office buildings in the commercial park. Energy management & CO2 intensity Reduce CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2020) by 2030 Establish/Optimise building management systems at all standing assets by 2022 Anchor guideline for sustainable building operations in all standing assets by 2022 UBM is equipping or refitting all standing assets with build-ing management systems to support energy optimisation. CO2 intensity will be reduced by refitting with highly efficient energy systems and building automation. In addition, a guide-line for sustainable building operations will be prepared for all tenants. GRI 3-3 In property development, the early planning phase defines the scope of the ecological footprint and can be seen as the key to an efficient circular economy. Our focus on struc-tural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their durability and their recycling capability. The EU Taxonomy anchors, among others, the transition to a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. through regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-struction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these requirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. The use of environmentally friendly and durable building materials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-efits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the lower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw material, stores carbon over the long term and is character-ised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity combined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost benefits through prefabrication and modular construction, lower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased space through narrower wall construction. And last but not least, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-faces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on the indoor climate. With timber construction, we have the largest lever in our hands as a real estate developer. The production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 intensive, and these materials should be recycled when a building is demolished. Later recycling capacity can be actively included as early as the planning stage, for example 74 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions over the entire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping with the focus on sustainability. GRI 2-23, 2-25 4.3. Ground sealing, climate change adjustments and biodiversity Urban development inevitably leads to interference with the local fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction activity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats and an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated areas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater due to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk of highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes the microclimate local temperatures increase and new heat records are set (heat islands) and can cause serious health problems for the people involved. The EU Taxonomy requires, among others, the protection of healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing construction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects for the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-tage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. Building permits in Austria are granted under sustainability aspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and biodiversity. UBMs goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-oped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground sealing. Preference is given to development projects located in urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are embedded in an existing infrastructure. through the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber can be easily recycled untreated wood can be reused or recycled, while dirtied or treated wood can be used as a renewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling in the sense of the circular economy. Goals and measures in detail: Sustainable building materials & circular economy Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building materials in all new development projects Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling for all new development projects The planning stage for all UBM projects must include and evaluate the use of sustainable and/or recycled building materials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to the planners. Lifecycle assessments (see section 4.1.2.) are used, above all, for building sections with massive components as well as building sections with different lifecycles and renovation cycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to optimise the selection of materials and component assembly and make an important contribution to resource conservation, the reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return to the materials cycle. In the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-ing is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with our green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given to recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-ally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials are separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is placed on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-cling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of all materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The remaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and the like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with legal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded Gold certification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition. 75 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##UBMs value chain for real estate development begins with an acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land in protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the realisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with intervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the destruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses on so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-sion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and limit ground sealing. In addition to conscious interaction with the resource land, the preservation of biological diversity is another important concern. It will be reflected in future projects through roof-tops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and facade greening which will help to reduce the heat island effect in our urban areas as well as the heating and cooling load. UBMs focal points for biodiversity are as follows: Brownfield developments Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities Increase in biological diversity through roof and facade greening Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening Goal from our sustainability programme: Brownfield development Goals and measures in detail: Brownfield development Increase share of brownfield developments in new projects to over 66% by 2025 As mentioned above, UBMs acquisition process is focused on brownfield developments (land with existing buildings). Biodiversity has been integrated in UBMs 360 process land-scape. The relevant parameters (tree stock, groundwater, con-tamination, previous use, etc.) for all asset classes are sur-veyed and monitored in accordance with the Land checklist. Our reporting on development projects is based solely on the sealed areas, with a differentiation between greenfield and brownfield. Greenfield developments represent roughly 24% of the 45,678 m in the ten projects completed during 2021. We also exchanged an area of 24,290 m on four brownfield projects.

Stricter legal requirements for building demolition can be expected in the future, for example through the consequent separation of construction and demolition waste or the production of quality-assured secondary building materials. Refurbishment projects are a fixed and steadily increasing component of UBMs real estate development portfolio. In comparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-tion, the conversion and vitalisation of existing buildings results in lower energy consumption and lower CO2 emis-sions an important ecological aspect that will also be taken into account in the future. Other resource-conserving benefits include the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new soil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and the preservation of existing building substance. The lifecycle of a building is extended as a result, and that reduces CO2 emissions. UBM has increased its focus on projects involving revitalisa-tion and has also set a goal to evaluate all refurbishment pro-jects based on sustainability criteria. Two projects underwent building certification in 2021, namely the Andaz Sugar Pal-ace in Prague (LEED) and the voco in The Hague (BREEAM). Of the 54 development projects in UBMs pipeline at the end 2021, six involved refurbishment and revitalisation during the construction and development phase. Thus, the projects on the following page are responsible for 75,769 m of the total pipeline (711,709 m GFA). 11% of the total area (or 13% of the number of projects) in the pipeline including 2021 is accounted for by revitalisation and redevelopment projects. 77 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##Renovation and revitalisation projects real estate development Projects total pipeline incl. 2021 Type of property Status GFA/number Development projects [m] total Renovation and revitalisation projects [m] total voco, The Hague Siebenbrunnengasse, Vienna Siebenbrunnengasse, Vienna Sugar Palace, Prague Smolensk, Krakow Swietnizka, Wrozlaw Unterbiberger Strae 15, Munich New construction projects [m] total Renovation and revitalisation projects [number] New construction projects [number] GRI 2-23, 2-25 Hotel Residential Commercial Hotel Residential Commercial Residential completed under constr. under constr. under constr. under constr. under dev. under dev. 711,709 75,769 11,030 17,389 6,322 16,395 7,906 8,302 8,425 635,940 7 47 % 100 11 89 13 87 4.5. Healthy building materials & the quality of life The use of healthy building materials has a positive influence on the indoor climate in UBMs buildings and the comfort for residents, office tenants and hotel guests. The avoidance of harmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-sives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy ambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, among others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-tal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in paints, insulation, flooring, etc.). UBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building certification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-ing materials. Timber is a particularly important product with regard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-ise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the indoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to its pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This is due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal insulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived as comfortable. GRI 2-23, 2-25 78 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##4.6. Water and wastewater utilisation and waste in building operations Examples of the measures taken in the standing assets and Group locations are provided below: At the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and facility management have developed a waste concept. We also ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna based on an established concept. A digital solution for waste management similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-ration. Paperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in 2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption and also complements the previously established controlling systems. On UBM Day, which was certified as a green meeting in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were also implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware was not used, the decorations were rented or designed for multiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all waste was correctly separated. GRI 2-23, 2-25 In the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-tion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and grey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings in kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of fresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-tainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through requirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection management plans). Water stress areas are areas in which the demand for water exceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where the usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-ity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of fresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, dehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, etc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively unaffected by water stress at the present time. Although consumption is primarily influenced by end users, we still implement effective measures. One example is the Mercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 green facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol of the green and clean motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in pockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on textile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater collected in the basement. Waste management is also important in building operations. The avoidance of waste saves energy and resources, and the organised collection of waste allows for correct material recycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste generation and separation. 79 UBM & ENVIRONMENT ##PAGE_BREAK##80 48UBM & SOCIAL 80 ##PAGE_BREAK##81 48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

Sustainable management is in no way limited to environ- mental aspects. It also covers a companys social responsibil-ity, in other words the impact of its actions on society. 5.1. Attractive employer & training and education This also includes fair and responsible interaction with our employees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and men who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-term success and essential for the positive development of our company. In this connection, we have defined the follow-ing focus areas: Attractive employer and training & education Diversity and equal opportunities Health and occupational safety As a real estate developer, we also have an impact on local communities and neighbouring residents. Our projects contribute to the quality of life for society. This applies, in particular, to urban quarter developments, but is also true for residential construction and office buildings. We are well aware that we change and influence the living environment of people with every real estate development project. That creates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, wherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with neighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the areas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement through our activities. This added value and neighbourhood vitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term. Accordingly, we have defined focal points in the following areas: Architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity Infrastructure & mobility Customer orientation and awareness creation We are well aware that we change and influence the living environment of people with every real estate development project. 5.1.1. Importance of the issue Qualified and motivated employees are an important factor for our companys long-term success. Attracting and retaining these women and men calls for an environment in which per-sonal development is possible and community is supported. The understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is undergoing a paradigm shift which has been accelerated by the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid increase in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life balance and creative opportunities are becoming more and more important. New work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for working hours and locations. However, a functioning remote work culture can never completely replace the office with its spontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, and sharing and shaping. Offices will, consequently, not become irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is where a company becomes visible, that is where community becomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-ence is lived and new ideas are born. The study The State of Skills 2021 shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but also reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-ities to invest in learning and development, combined with rising demands on new skills and competences can cause problems at several levels over the long term. Employees with insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their activities at a higher quality level and when confidence in their own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, assignments take longer, and both quality and motivation decline. Training and education therefore create benefits 82 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-how and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and supporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and satisfaction for everyone involved. A greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop and retain sufficient specialists and managers. A lack of opportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and productivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, recruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. In the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an attractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-pliance with the respective national laws governing employ-ment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well as consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-dations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers must respect human rights, reject child labour and forced labour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-ers, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair compensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the rejection of any form of discrimination. Unattractive working conditions can damage a companys reputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-rienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour market. News of bad experience with employers in online application platforms or social media can also be expected to spread rapidly. In the end, the companys positioning on the market will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential employees may wander to the competition. GRI 3-3 5.1.2. Our commitment We owe our success to our talented, committed employ-ees who take on individual responsibility and want to play an active role in designing UBMs success. UBM supports its employees in reaching their personal career goals and offers them opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and development possibilities and numerous benefits. With our values competent. consequent. transparent. we create a working climate in which each person feels included, authorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. We encourage our employees to be proactive through short decision paths and flat hierarchies. The design of our working environment reflects our strict com-pliance with the national and international rules and require-ments in the markets where we are active. We also base our actions on agreements that include the Universal Declara-tion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This commitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code and code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.). Modern workplace & community Open communications are a central element of our corpo-rate values and an important building block for our attractive-ness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working spaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and performance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, for example, include a lounge with table football and darts as well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a barbecue area. Specially created new work zones serve as multifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing as a communication and collaboration platform. Our Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, supports the exchange of information and an open corporate culture across business areas and national borders. In addi-tion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise events like barista workshops and joint participation in sport events to promote teambuilding. Work-life balance We believe it is important to help our employees establish a healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and family life. Individual working time models are part of our efforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the company agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family members. Employees have access to special time off under certain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-tled to parental leave. 83 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##Open communications are a central element of our corporate values and an important building block for our attractiveness as an employer. Performance-based remuneration With very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that are tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM employees participate in the companys success. Benefits Additional benefits include, among others, the reimburse-ment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-sidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-ance. Special projects to help employees remain healthy include in-house fitness programmes and a subsidy for annual membership in a fitness studio. An important part of this policy specifies that these benefits are also available to part-time employees. In this respect, UBM does not differen-tiate between full-time and part-time employees. Career, training and continuing education Specially planned training and continuing education pro-grammes are a fixed part of human resources development at UBM. The basis is formed by the annual appraisal meet-ing, which includes an agreement on goals and specific training measures together with the responsible supervisor. UBM actively offers numerous educational opportunities ranging from internal workshops and idea competitions to external training programmes, but also encourages and supports the independent development of its employees. GRI 2-23, 2-25, 3-3, 401-2, 404-2 We actively offer numerous devel-opment opportunities as part of our human resources strategy, but also encourage employees independent development. 5.1.3. Organisational structure At the Management Board level, the COO is responsible for personnel-related issues which are centrally combined under human resources. The head of human resources meets regularly with the COO to discuss developments in this area. Targets, measures and the strategic focus are defined together with the Management Board and communicated to the organisation. The human resources team also includes an HR business partner who implements human resources measures together with local management in agreement with the HR strategy. GRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3 5.1.4. Goals and measures Goals from our sustainability programme: Minimise employee turnover Yearly ESG training Goals and measures in detail: Recruit the best employees for UBM Increase number of applicants Increase quality of applicants and continuous increase starting in 2022 Ensure high probability of hiring To reach these goals, UBM has implemented targeted meas-ures to establish an employer branding strategy. Its goal is to increase the attractiveness of UBM as an employer for potential applicants and to continuously improve the candi-date experience. The related measures include the develop-ment of a career website, increased online presence, e.g. in LinkedIn or kununu, and preparation of job and skills profiles for all job classifications. The indicators used to monitor target attainment include the number of applications per advertised position, interview quota (first survey scheduled for 2022), the offer-acceptance rate or time-to-hire after the job advertisement. 84 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##Retain the best employees Hold employee turnover below 12.5% by 2025 The creation of an employer branding strategy will also increase the attractiveness of UBM for existing employees. The related measures include a structured onboarding pro-cess for all new employees, flexible working time models, attractive remuneration, regular information for employees via internal communication channels, internal opportunities for advancement, and the preparation of job and skills pro-files for all job classifications. The turnover rate for the entire UBM Group equalled 12.9% in 2021. Other indicators for internal monitoring include aver-age length of service with the company, the share of man-agement positions filled internally and the recommendation quota. Train and educate the best employees Promote feedback culture annual appraisals with all employees 25% more training hours per employee by 2025 (basis 2020) Annual ESG awareness training for all employees starting in 2022 Individual, requirements-oriented training measures are defined in regular personnel development and feedback discussions with employees based on an internal guideline. These discussions are held with all employees, regardless of the hierarchy level. A project is currently in progress to sup-port the organised recording of employee appraisals. The COVID-19 pandemic created an additional challenge by limiting the offering and resulting in the cancellation of training courses and seminars. The percentage of employees who participated in training fell from 65% in 2020 to 35% in 2021. However, the average hours of training per employee remained constant at around 17 hours. In 2021, a special training initiative was launched in support of ESG issues: Numerous employees voluntarily took part in the Climate Impact Day to improve their understanding of ESG. The active participation of all employees in this event is planned to begin in 2022. Other internal events and training (e.g. internal courses, projects related to the green. smart. and more. initiative) and targeted internal communication will create a greater awareness for the importance of ESG. GRI 2-23, 2-25, 3-3 5.2. Diversity and equal opportunities A working environment free of discrimination and a culture of mutual respect and appreciation throughout the entire workforce these are the requirements for equal opportu-nities and diversity in a company. A company that does not promote diversity and equal opportunities risks damage to its reputation and, in the worst case, could be faced with legal consequences. Poor performance in this area can undermine a companys position on the market and result in the loss of business part-ners and customers. Innovation potential is also lost when the personal backgrounds of employees (e.g. migration back-ground, nationality, family constellations) are ignored. The lack of equal opportunities at the workplace (remunera-tion etc.) can lead to lower employee motivation and higher turnover, which means additional costs and time for new hir-ing. Moreover, there are signs that the legal requirements governing equal opportunities will be strengthened in the future. Fair treatment of our employees and a culture of mutual respect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all employees equally regardless of their ethnic, national or social background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or religious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic or other standing. Decisive action is taken against any form of discrimination. 85 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK## Goal from our sustainability programme: Over 30% women in management positions Goals and measures in detail: No salary differences between women and men by 2025 (adjusted gender pay gap) Increase percentage of women in management positions to over 30% by 2025 Increase percentage of women in the total workforce to ca. 50% by 2025 Diversity has high priority for UBM. It allows us to utilise the full potential of the labour market and innovation by includ-ing people with different backgrounds and viewpoints. The employment of staff with different ages and experience is encouraged (buddy principle), and the company is increasing its efforts to raise the percentage of female employees in the organisation. Activities to sustainably improve equal opportunities include recruiting that is focused on the search for suitable female candidates. Women are directly addressed through appro-priate wording in job advertisements, and clear guidelines give preference to women when qualifications and experi-ence are equal. In new hiring, there are no salary differences between the genders when the function, qualifications and seniority are equal. Starting in 2022, we plan to calculate the adjusted gender pay gap for the entire company as the basis for implementing specific measures. In comparison with other companies in the real estate sector, the UBM Group had a positive standing with 25 women in key positions as of 31 December 2021 (Supervisory Board, managing directors, authorised signatories and key staff at UBM Development AG and its subsidiaries). A comparison with the 24 female managers in 2020 shows an improvement in the share of women in leading positions. The percentage of women in management positions equalled 26.6% and the percentage in the total workforce equalled ca. 45% in 2021. Specific instructions give women preference when qualifications and experience are equal. The Supervisory Board does not follow a specific diversity concept with regard to the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards because the establishment of diver-sity targets for control bodies is not seen as expedient or use-ful. Education and professional experience play a significant role because a person under consideration for a Supervisory Board position must be capable of optimally performing his or her duties. These preconditions are not defined abstractly in advance but evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Accord-ingly, the expertise and specific requirements for the respec-tive appointment are the only decisive factors in preparing proposals for the Annual General Meeting. Women represent 25% of the positions on the Management Board and 33% on the Supervisory Board. GRI 2-9, 2-17, 2-23, 2-25 86 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##5.3. Health and safety Work absences can result in financial damages, the loss of know-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health and injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-ical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-istent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased sickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are associated with health and injury risks, among others through severe or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-ative effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-istrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal consequences for the employer. Our business success is based to a significant degree on the commitment and motivation of our employees. As an employer, we also feel responsible for their physical and psychological health. Goals and measures in detail: Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level goal: zero work accidents Protect and promote employees health As a real estate developer, support for employees physical and psychological health in everyday office routines plays a central role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-pational physician, in-house fitness rooms). A major focal point for construction sites involves occupational safety measures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection including training). UBM has implemented an integrated management system to support occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-ees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-tria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified under the internationally recognised occupational health and safety management norm ISO , and certifi-cation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. Occupational safety management includes experts like occu-pational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and employee representatives in line with national requirements. Safety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-uates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety inspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety throughout the company and ensure compliance with high safety standards. The success of these measures is reflected in the number of work accidents, which has been extremely low for many years. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-dents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- related illnesses were recorded. In addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-ority on employees health. The related measures include, among others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and the opportunity to individually use the in-house fitness rooms. Outdoor athletes can join the UBM-Express and take part in various running events. An occupational physi-cian is also available to assist employees at UBMs Vienna location. GRI 2-23, 2-25 87 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##5.4. Architecture, urban quarter development and social diversity The coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards an ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-logical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased to also include social aspects. Todays development projects should reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-ing and working to also meet the needs of tomorrows users. The failure to include carefully thought-out architectural concepts for buildings and urban development projects can result in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs of the future. A balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the basis for the sustainable development of residential areas. Smart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-efits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings for users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-tional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases the quality of life in the surrounding area. Our many years of experience as a real estate developer have taught us that development means change and inter-action. One of our key principles is to always consider and integrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For us, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-tial negative effects on the local area, for example caused by shading, artificial light, noise, emission and increased traffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive changes and improvements. The health and well-being of later users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in project development. Included here, for example, are room temperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the optical design. To make these phrases come alive, our approach includes sustainability certificates like DGNB and GNI as key meas-urement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the three-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and society. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-tificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- ability certification over the long term for all our projects, also in the residential asset class. Our projects create living and working space that influences the health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM therefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of the building materials used and the integration of the demo-graphic shift in its construction projects. UBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-mative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far beyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements whenever this is important to future users. The following key aspects for the functionality of buildings represent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its real estate projects: Accessibility Absence of pollutants and construction ecology Indoor climate and acoustics Security Visual comfort (look & feel) UBM sees building certification through its continuous development and adaptation to meet new market demands and trends as an important tool to make sure its projects are fit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. smart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with established certification systems during the planning and construction phase. GRI 2-23, 2-25 88 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##5.5. Infrastructure and mobility The steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges for municipal planning and development. Modern mobility concepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real estate planning and the design of urban quarters. Sustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage concept for the specific building and for its urban quarter. That also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-structure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) as well as sustainable mobility concepts (car/bike sharing, e-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-lar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of living, working and hotel stays. UBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-oped a future-oriented mobility concept for the Timber Pioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce the use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-tination and origin transportation. The following offering is designed to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-tally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-ing users: E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for e-bike batteries Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle E-bike hire stations Additional bicycle storage areas Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers and changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair point Some of these services, for example car sharing and the e-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in the neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower which creates excellent and efficient synergies for both buildings. At the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be able to use e-charging stations in the office and residential areas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing products. The Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, is currently carrying out a manage to green project that involves the refitting of two buildings to include parking spaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, e-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking spaces in the business park. GRI 2-23, 2-25 5.6. Customer orientation and awareness raising A focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads to longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and complaints. Customer orientation measures can include the early involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for important issues raised by different social groups, or conflict management processes. The creation of a greater aware-ness of sustainability issues can also improve users sense of well-being. Insufficient or a complete lack of customer orientation can lead to declining revenues, market access problems and lower corporate profitability. UBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to sustainable urban development and create benefits for the general public. These quarters must be resistant against com-ing climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in the future. 89 UBM & SOCIAL ##PAGE_BREAK##The development of an urban quarter means much more than just planning and constructing a building. Many dif-ferent stakeholder groups are involved in these activities, including project developers, planners, public authorities and district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, and the complexity is accordingly high. We involve rele-vant stakeholder groups in our planning and development processes through early information, participation and co- determination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to express their needs and interests and influence results. This approach has been embedded in UBMs process landscape as the standard since 2021. We involve relevant stakeholder groups in our planning and development processes at an early stage through information, participa-tion and co-determination rights. In this way, initial reservations by a citizens initiative concern-ing a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder Hfe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this project and for all other UBM developments is to also create an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-tive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, green and open areas available for public use, other benefits include the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and good public transportation connections via underground and rapid transit railway. The LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-cessful participative urban development. This area is under development based on specifications set by the citys devel-opment commission and the integration of citizens concerns. Up-to-date information on the progress of construction is published on a project website, and an ombudsman service is available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. In close cooperation with the representatives of public authorities, decisions are coordinated on relevant issues involving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects like working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible reduction of emissions and immissions. The instruments to reach these goals are diverse. Green areas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground storage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time data on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-tion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-tier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the green zone an expanded green area in the inner courtyard is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the quality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special attention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-tion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-ditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-sive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be installed on these roofs to create a balance between energy production and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier will generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. Heating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter will be produced centrally and CO2-neutral. Local supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are the basic components of this urban quarter development project. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and shared activities, the use of a quarter management app is also under evaluation to make the offerings and services available to users and neighbours. All these measures will help to create smart and green living space that sustainably increases and improves the value of the area surrounding the LeopoldQuartier. The LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the implementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for sustainable urban quarter development. Construction is scheduled to start in 2023.

Sustainable procurement & regional added value 6.3. Innovation & technologies as in GovernanceG93 ##PAGE_BREAK##Governance. Living good management. In addition to the environment and society, good governance plays an increasingly important role in the perception and valuation of companies. For UBM, good governance means being viewed as a trustworthy and reliable partner by our stakeholders. That is the foundation of our business success. UBMs values competent. consequent. transparent. are reflected in our social responsibility: act ethically, accept the consequences, communicate transparently. To ensure that our values are lived throughout the entire company and reflected in our employees everyday activities, our actions are based on ethical principles, relevant national and inter-national legal norms, and internal guidelines. As an active part of society, we accept our responsibility and have identified the following material subject areas as part of our materiality analysis: Corporate governance & compliance Sustainable procurement & regional added value Innovation & technologies 6.1. Corporate governance & compliance 6.1.1. Importance of the issue Compliance with regulatory requirements and voluntary standards is an important part of responsible management. The construction and management of properties produces social benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, but also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous substances into the environment which, in turn, increases the pressure on (local) public authorities. The relevance of compliance and compliance management systems has increased significantly in recent years for many different reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new legal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties and, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming more and more consequent. Violations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-cant risk for companies but are also connected with personal consequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-alties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, that can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the companys reputation. Key aspects of real estate development include, above all, correct tenders (e.g. for construction services), the fight against corruption and bribery, proper working conditions and taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-parent internal guidelines and conduct rules. The issue of human rights along the entire value chain deserves special attention and has gained momentum in recent years also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable finance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-ity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-sifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and strengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory Board (Sustainable Corporate Governance) to include man-datory human rights and environmental due diligence. Companies that fail to meet environmental standards or ethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial markets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and financial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, EU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to meet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of transparency. GRI 3-3 94 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##6.1.2. Our commitment Responsible actions start at an individual level but, as a company, we have a duty and responsibility to create the necessary framework. UBM does this, for example, through transparent internal directives and a code of conduct, com-mitment to various corporate governance guidelines and the UN Global Compact, and an effective internal compliance management system. Responsible and transparent management has top priority for UBM. Compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, guidelines, standards and norms in the countries where UBM is active goes without saying. The high demands we set for ourselves also apply to our business partners and employees. UBMs business model is oriented on ecological, social and ethically correct business practices. In order to strengthen the integration of ecological and social responsibility along the entire value chain, UBM has issued various behavioural requirements. UBMs focus markets are strictly regulated and controlled legal areas with high human rights standards. Nonetheless, violations can also occur in heavily regulated markets, and respect for human rights is therefore anchored in internal guidelines. We are committed to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact which, for example, prohibit child labour and forced labour. Our codes of conduct (ethic code and code of conduct for business partners) require guarantees for fair compensation, workplace safety, support for equal opportunity and the freedom of association, for example. Our responsible and transparent management is based on the following cornerstones: Austrian Code of Corporate Governance UBM, as an international listed company, has pledged its commitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a voluntary guideline for good management and control. The company has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-nal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions. Compliance Management System The compliance management system implemented by UBM is intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal regulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-tions. A compliance management system manual details the responsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation as well as the processes which implement the related rules and guidelines. The Management Board and Supervisory Board consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-sequent implementation of all compliance principles. Our approach follows the principle of prevention disclosure reaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect behaviour. The trust of employees, business partners, customers and other stakeholders is strengthened by UBMs focus on trans-parency, anti-corruption, fair business practices, the pre-vention of money laundering and data protection. Internal guidelines and work instructions form the framework for the necessary procedures examples are: Consequent compliance with applicable national and inter-national legal norms as well as our ethical principles safe-guards the trust of our stakeholders. We are non-partisan and do not make any donations to political parties. Guideline: Cartel and Competition Law Agreements and coordinated actions with third-party com-panies that lead to or aim to lead to the restriction of competition are prohibited and will not be tolerated by UBM. Guideline: Anti-corruption UBM employees are prohibited, without exception, from accepting or granting monetary gifts. Material gifts to employees of public organisations are also prohibited with-out exception. Small invitations and gifts can represent part of international business customs or cultural practices and 95 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##are only permitted under strictly regulated circumstances and only in connection with employees of non-public organisa-tions. agreement with Art. 32 of the MAR, appropriate protection is given to persons who report violations and persons who are accused of violations as well as their personal data. Work instructions: Signatures All correspondence with a legally or commercially binding content as well as orders for goods or services must, in prin-ciple, be signed by two persons (dual control principle) who are specifically authorised or designated. Guideline for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing and work instructions: Prevention of Money Laundering Before a business relationship begins, its purpose and the identity of the business partner or ownership structure for legal entities must be precisely identified and regularly mon-itored. The principle here is know your customer. Work instructions: Data Maintenance 360 Data maintenance and consequent data entry are essential for the correct performance of our systems. Further informa-tion on the 360 process landscape can be found on page 97. Guideline: Conflicts of Interest UBM employees must make sure their own interests do not come into conflict with their professional obligations or coun-ter UBMs obligations towards its business partners. UBM operates a whistleblowing system as defined in Art. 32 of the EUs Market Abuse Directive (MAR) which allows employ-ees and external persons to report irregularities and (potential) violations of this regulation. Reports can be submitted directly to a staff member in the compliance organisation or sent by email to or anonymously via the link The reporting of potential violations is in the interest of the Management Board as well as the management of the Group companies. In Data protection UBM is committed to the confidential and responsible handling of personal data in agreement with the applicable data pro-tection laws above all the EU Data Protection Regulation and related national legislation. Secure handling is guaranteed by a data protection manual that includes rules for internal data processing, work procedures and their monitoring. Regular employee training and surveys create a greater awareness of this sensitive issue and make sure data protec-tion does not drift out of focus. Ethics code A separate, binding ethics code forms the basis for all busi-ness activities and decisions. It is the foundation for moral, ethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-ees and is designed to prevent mistakes. The values and principles contained in the code are based on national and international laws and requirements and on agreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-ness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-tional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation (in particular the Fundamental Principles of the IAO). The subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among others, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-tal and human rights, working conditions, occupational safety and health, environmental protection, the prevention of money laundering, and data protection. This code has been expressly agreed in writing with all employees in their 96 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##national language since 2021 and is regularly adapted to reflect developments in the social and regulatory environ-ment as well as ethic values. The last update was completed in December 2021. Further information on the ethics code can also be found on our website under the menu item ESG. Code of conduct for business partners We not only place high priority on responsible actions by all UBM employees, but also set high standards for our busi-ness partners. A separate code of conduct for our business partners is firmly anchored in our corporate processes and regularly adapted to reflect developments in the business and regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic val-ues. The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and included requirements for all business partners to strengthen the integration of ecological and social responsibility along the entire value chain. This code is based on the same principles and regulations as the ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamental and human rights, working conditions, occupational safety and health, environmental protection, the prevention of money laundering, and data protection. The code of conduct applies to all business part-ners who sell their products or services to UBM. If a business partner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated contracts will not be signed and the compliance officer is immediately informed. He will then decide together with the Management Board on further procedures. In the event the code is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable measures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-sion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with the business partner. Further information on the code of conduct for business part-ners can be found on our website under the menu item ESG. Works Council UBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected every four years. Four of these members are delegated to the Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the votes. UBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the respective national frameworks as well as representation on the Supervisory Board. The Works Council also takes part in collective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with UBMs approval. The newly founded ESG Committee also includes one member from the Works Council. During the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or violations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBMs oper-ating locations or suppliers. Transparent processes UBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which go beyond legal requirements. These processes are opera-tionally standardised through an institutionalised 360 prin-ciple. More specifically: As part of the Next Level efficiency programme, all core and support processes for project devel-opment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates and ultimately defined for the entire company. Roles and responsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and the control mechanisms were revised and improved. These procedures and rules give employees the corresponding tools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design of processes and controls. 97 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##We are convinced that these types of work instructions, guidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-munication and documentation, and help to make processes more efficient. They also make effective controls possible. UBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-ance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and to quickly identify and correct any weak points in business and organisational processes, on the other hand. The internal control system and internal audit Our internal control system (ICS) is an integral part of our business processes. The most important goals of this control system are to: Monitor compliance with business policies and defined goals Safeguard the companys assets Guarantee the reliability of accounting and reporting Maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes Identify risks at an early point in time Reliably assess potential risks Monitor compliance with legal requirements Ensure the efficient use of resources and cost savings In addition to the controls in core processes, UBM has installed commercial and technical controlling functions. Both report directly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling monitors the ongoing development of business to identify deviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes certain management receives the necessary information. Technical controlling monitors project development with a focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-gress and all processes important for technical realisation.

Organisational structure Compliance management at UBM is installed in the legal, corporate and compliance department, which is also respon-sible for the content of the related guidelines. A compliance officer and deputy were appointed by the Management Board of UBM AG. The compliance guidelines are prepared by the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-ment Board and communicated to all employees. All UBM employees have digital access to these guidelines. The compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines and is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes in legal regulations. The compliance guidelines are reviewed annually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and internal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of the compliance management system. The key positions in the internal data protection organisation are the data protection coordinator and one data protection officer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-ment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-lation of a data breach response team for the management and reporting of data protection violations in agreement with the data protection guideline. A money laundering officer has also been appointed. As part of KYC reviews (know your customer), he compares the data received with sanction lists, entries in the register of economic owners, etc. Additional information on the KYC reviews can be found on page 100. The respective organisational units implement the individual internal guidelines and work instructions. For example: The managing directors of the country organisations are respon-sible for the operational implementation and control of work instructions related to the code of conduct and ethics code. 98 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##The quality management department is responsible for pro-cedural instructions and documents related to the 360 pro-cess landscape as well as the coordination of and support for regular audits and confirmation through ISO certificates. GRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3 Supervisory Board self-evaluation The Supervisory Board carried out a self-evaluation of the efficiency of its activities, above all the organisation and work-ing procedures, during 2021 in accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. 6.1.4. Goals and measures Goals from our sustainability programme: Code of conduct for business partners Code of conduct for employees Goals and measures in detail: Safeguard entrepreneurial compliance and responsible actions Fair business practices and zero tolerance for any form of cor-ruption these principles are a fixed part of our business cul-ture. We have implemented the following measures to support this approach and anchor these principles in our company. There were no confirmed cases of corruption, proven money laundering incidents or other violations of rules and regu-lations that would have led to fines or non-monetary sanc-tions in 2021 or 2020. Furthermore, there were no confirmed cases where contracts with business partners were cancelled or not extended due to violations involving corruption, and no confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of employees due to corruption. There were no proceedings for anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-ination incidents. Whistleblower system The whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover violations of data protection regulations and other report-able incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. It will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports in connection with UBMs ethics code and made available in Czech and Polish. 99 Quality management system ISO 9001 certification is intended to make sure the pro-cess-oriented quality management system is based on the highest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-tified under the international quality management norm ISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-tification covered 62% of UBMs workforce in 2021. Remuneration model The possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model will be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in managements variable remuneration over the medium term. Implement guidelines and prevent misconduct by consequent preventive activities Employee training The goal of training is to create a greater awareness among employees for potential sources of risk and, in this way, prevent corruption and anti-competitive behaviour. New employees receive training from the compliance depart-ment immediately after they join UBM. Regular e-learning programmes cover compliance with guidelines on different subjects like the anti-corruption guideline and the guide-line on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to ensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, and the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-pliance guideline to prevent market abuse. Most of the classroom training on compliance regulations has been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 174 employee training courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance issues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money laundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##reworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case examples. The compliance team frequently visits training courses, and there are additional certifications for selected responsibilities (for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified as a compliance officer under ISO ). The procedure for the distribution of relevant corporate guidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-ees will be notified separately of any relevant changes in existing guidelines. Ethics code The ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees in their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet our sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-gration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, the focus on human rights and environmental protection was reinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG is also supported by company events and training (like the Climate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the green. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal communication. Sampling controls of insider information The compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-itor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider information and confidential and price-sensitive information. Additional clarification briefings are held if necessary. Prevent money laundering and terrorism financing KYC review of new business partners Know your customer is one of the basic principles underly-ing the guideline for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing and the work instructions on money laundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by requiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate disclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and the acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due diligence requirements are connected, among others, with transactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of the guideline on the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk countries and contracts with politically exposed persons. The money laundering officer uses special procedures to review all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-dering. Over 250 business partners were extensively reviewed in 2021. Internal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing UBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of its commercial activities. The related activities are classified internationally as having an increased risk of money launder-ing, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated regularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The risk analysis for all Austrian subsidiaries which have registered brokerage as one of their commercial activities was updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the respective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement & regional added value Increasing regulations in various European countries require the implementation of corporate due diligence procedures in supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and traceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent processing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream suppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first step, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire upstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials producers) and the related working conditions and human rights situation. Goals and measures in detail: Ensuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the value chain Compliance with social and ecological criteria in the sup-ply chain is a key factor for UBMs sustainable procurement. Cooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction companies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the local economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-pliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost and time savings, protection for local jobs). Last, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have created a greater awareness of the importance of the local economy. As a major customer for construction companies, planners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-nificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto says Think global, order local. Regional business partners, meaning companies near the respective locations, play an important role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs and regional added value directly at UBMs project locations. Regional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. On the one hand, local companies are supported and, on the other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes that reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of larger components. This was demonstrated, among others, by the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist was commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and energy-saving timber construction. UBM created jobs and added value with this project, directly as well as indirectly. The code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section 6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of their responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to the sustainable development of the real estate sector. This code is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The last update was made in December 2021. A technical solution for compliance documentation is currently in preparation and will be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-tractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed through sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-tractor management system will be introduced in 2022. A procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen ecological and social responsibility along the supply chain. It defines standardised criteria and requirements for the ecologically oriented procurement of office and advertising materials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection of an organic fruit supplier for UBMs headquarters in Vienna now ensures deliveries based on seasonal and regional factors. Daily meals for employees are also supplied by a delivery service that provides organic foods. 101 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-ment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-logical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-scored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification of most of our commercial projects including residential construction in the future based on recognised sustainability seals like DNGB, GNI, LEED or BREEAM. The green. smart. and more. initiative In line with the above-mentioned management approach, the green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. It is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that covered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The focus was placed on the following seven core issues which were defined in a dialogue between the Management Board and Executive Committee: These certifications also involve external experts and auditors to confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. Minimising the environmental impact of a building during its entire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating energy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning stage. The economic dimension covers the construction costs as well as subsequent building costs incurred over the entire usage period or lifetime of the building. GRI 2-23, 2-25 Design & Construction Energy Building Operations Look & Feel User Services Technology & Data Mobility 6.3. Innovation & technologies Internal and external research activities and innovations for sustainable buildings are relevant for the entire added value chain, whereby organisational, social and technical issues are considered. The use of smart building technology (e.g. sen-sors for smart ventilation, intelligent shading), for example, can make an important contribution to energy savings and efficiency improvements and, in this way, reduce the negative impact on people and the environment. An urban quarter that incorporates social aspects, e.g. communication areas, interactive commercial areas (co-working spaces, etc.) con-tributes to the social structure and interaction in the quarter. smart. is UBMs keyword above all for new optimisation and control technologies as well as digitalisation. These activities are focused on the following: Ideas and concepts were developed for these core areas as answers to the challenges created by climate change. The prevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building materials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-gration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-words. The areas of Design & Construction, Energy and Build-ing Operations, in particular, offer green starting points. UBM responded with the following flagship projects: Timber high-rise Timber Pioneer (Frankfurt) Quarter certification for the LeopoldQuartier (Vienna) barany.7 timber residential construction (Vienna) Green & Clean Hotel (Katowice) The goals for green building certification were also reset. As in the past, all new commercial buildings will be certified. 102 UBM & GOVERNANCE ##PAGE_BREAK##Digitalisation of the UBM working world The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of the central role played by digitalisation in keeping the economy, educational system and society running smoothly during the lockdowns. UBM has made massive investments in the Groups digitalisation in recent years and plans to continue these efforts in the future. UBM launched the Next Level project in 2017 to digitally map operating and work processes as well as reporting and controlling at corporate level. The newBM project started in 2020 and is intended to move digitalisation at UBM a great qualitative leap forward, especially in the commercial areas but also in IT and infrastructure. The newBM project included the development of an SAP S/4 HANA system based on standard processes and SAP best practices for 250 companies. A modern system supports the full digital management of HR processes, and a central treas-ury system safeguards the encrypted, safe and integrated handling of payment flows throughout the Group. The IT con-version also includes the latest IT equipment and is focused on productivity, security and flexible working. GRI 2-23, 2-25 Moreover: The certification of two listed revitalisation projects continued in 2021 and will be completed shortly Certification has focused since 2021 not only on commercial projects but also on all new residential construction projects scheduled for global sales Quarter certification is targeted with the LeopoldQuartier as a flagship project The core issues of User Services, Technology & Data and Mobility are designed to make UBMs real estate develop-ment intelligent through the use of technological solu-tions and, as a result, improve and individualise the user ex- perience. As early as the planning stage, UBM ensures that buildings are equipped for future smartness trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) or sensors and can be adapted accordingly. Future-oriented mobility concepts will also play a role in quar-ter development projects through the interaction of e-mo-bility, shared services and intelligent parking concepts. The needs of users and the local environment can therefore be met with the highest possible level of efficiency and resource protection. In order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM cre-ated the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022. This non-profit foundation provides a platform for partners from industry and science to develop technical application solutions for smart buildings.

About this report This report is UBMs second ESG report and fifth sustainability report. It provides information on the 2021 financial year of UBM Development AG. UBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which was based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled in a more compact non-financial statement that was part of financial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 was prepared in agreement with the GRI standards Core Option. This report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-ance with 267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-cial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar year and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. The next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-tion on the 2022 financial year. The report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant for UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-lowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-ments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-entation of information from previous reports is documented in the footnotes beginning on page 112. The reported indi-cators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019. The management of UBM Development AG is responsible for preparation of the report content. An external review with limited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125). If you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please feel free to contact UBM at Current information on sustainability can also be found on our website under the menu item ESG. Gender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-sible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no distinction was made between the genders. In the sense of equal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to all genders. Scope of consolidation This report covers the corporate locations, standing assets and development projects of UBM Development in Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets. In the hotel business, which was a focal point of activities before the strategic reorientation, UBM took over the role of the lessee in selected cases following the sale of the respective properties. The hotel leasing business was bun-dled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and UBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, international hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-ational management of these houses, whereby preference is given to partners who are aware of their ecological and social responsibility and have appropriate certification. This report does not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel operating company, which represents an equity-accounted investment, because UBM is unable to control the related measures and guidelines. The indicators in the section on the environment cover all companies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all Group locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and projects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-ber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and improved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based primarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database (v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. Where actual consumption figures are not available, esti-mates are used (mainly for project development, where the energy consumption is calculated as per certificates). Details are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112. GRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2 106 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ##PAGE_BREAK##7.2.

Winkler CEO, Chairman Martin Lcker COO Patric Thate CFO Martina Maly-Grtner COO 124 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ##PAGE_BREAK##Report on the independent assurance of non-financial reporting Independent Limited Assurance Report on the ESG Report (Translation) We performed a limited assurance engagement of the ESG report in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB (Austrian Company Code) and of the GRI Standards 2021 (hereinafter the ESG report) of UBM Development AG, Vienna (the Company) for the financial year 2021. Managements Responsibility Management is responsible for the preparation of the ESG Report in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of the GRI Standards 2021. Managements Responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the ESG reporting (in particular the selection of key issues) as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual ESG disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances, and for such internal controls as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of an ESG report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our procedures performed and evidence obtained as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Companys ESG report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of the GRI Standards 2021. We performed our engagement in accordance with the professional standards applicable in Austria with regard to KFS/PG 13 Other assurance engagements, KFS/PE28 Selected issues in connection with the assurance of non-financial statements and non-financial reports pursuant to sections 243b and 267a UGB as well as sustainability reports and on the International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of his-torical financial information. These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-pendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained. Our report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract (AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors ( ), which also apply towards third parties. As provided under section 275 para. 2 UGB (liability provision regarding the audit of financial statements of small and medium-sized companies), our responsibility and liability towards the Company and any third parties arising from the assurance engagement are limited to a total of EUR 2 million. 125 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ##PAGE_BREAK##The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is sub-stantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following: Evaluating the overall presentation of the disclosures and non-financial information Critical assessment of the Companys analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders by inter- viewing the responsible employees and inspecting relevant documents Obtaining an overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including the due diligence processes implemented as well as the processes used to ensure an accurate presentation in the ESG report by interviewing the Companys management and inspecting internal guidelines, procedural instructions and management systems in connection with non-financial matters/disclosures Obtaining an understanding of reporting processes by interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected docu- mentations Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indica- tors, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations. All interviews as well as procedures were performed by virtual means due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the coronavirus containment measures Examining the ESG report regarding its completeness in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of the GRI Standards 2021 The following is not part of our engagement: Examining the processes and internal controls particularly regarding their design, implementation and effectiveness Performing procedures at individual locations as well as measurements or individual evaluations to check the reliability and accuracy of data received Examining the prior-year figures, forward-looking information or data from external surveys Examining the correct transfer of data and references from the (consolidated) financial statements to the non-financial reporting; and Examining the information and disclosures on the website or further references on the internet Neither an audit nor a review of financial statements is objective of our engagement. Furthermore, neither the disclosure and solution of criminal acts, as e.g. embezzlement or other kinds of fraud, and wrongful doings, nor the assessment of the effectiveness and profitability of the management are the objectives of our engagement. 126 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ##PAGE_BREAK##Restriction of Use Because our report is prepared solely for and on behalf of the client, it does not constitute a basis for any reliance on is con-tents by other third parties. Therefore, no claims of other third parties can be derived from it. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Companys ESG Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and of the GRI Standards 2021.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by words like expecta-tion, goal or similar terms and expressions. Forward-looking statements, by definition, include risks and uncertainties. The forecasts con-cerning the future development of the company represent estimates which are based on the information available at the time the annual report was prepared. If the assumptions underlying these forecasts do not materialise or if unexpected risks occur at an amount not quan-tified or quantifiable, the actual future development and actual future results can differ from these estimates, assumptions and forecasts. Significant factors for these types of deviations can include, for example, changes in the general economic environment or the legal and reg-ulatory framework in Austria and the EU as well as changes in the real estate sector. UBM Development AG will not guarantee or assume any liability for the agreement of future development and future results with the estimates and assumptions made in this ESG report. UBM Development AG will not update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual events or changes in assumptions and expectations. The ESG report as of 31 December 2021 was prepared with the greatest possible care to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information in all sec-tions. The amounts were rounded based on the compensated summation method. However, rounding, typesetting and printing errors cannot be excluded. This ESG report is published in English and German and is available in both languages on the website of UBM Development AG. In the event of a discrepancy or deviation, the German language version takes precedence.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##5\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nOur strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more. \\n\\nThat shows just how important \\nsustainability is for UBM.  \\nIt represents the focal point  \\nof all our actions. \\n\\nThis report explains the  \\nvarious aspects of  \\nsustainability in connection  \\nwith the Environment,  \\nSocial and Governance.\\n\\n6\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\n1.

It is a conviction that is also reflected in \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. \\n\\n \\n\\n1.2. Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand setting a value for the sale which can be included in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\npro tability and risk. UBM s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a  one-stop shop . We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management,  nancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor  nal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and of ce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM s  core  markets  is  also  well- lled  for  the \\nfuture  with   2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nof ce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue of roughly  300m in its standing investment portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.  UBM s  basic  strategic  focus,  however,  is  that  of  a \\n Pure Play Developer .

Competence and consequence  \\n\\nalong the value chain \\n\\nCompetence  along  the  entire  value  chain  is  also  part  of \\nUBM s  DNA,  whereby  sustainability  is  a  central  aspect. \\nBecause  every  decision  we  make  in  connection  with  the \\ndevelopment  of  a  property  has  an  impact  on  the  global \\nclimate  for  the  coming  decades.  A  conviction  that  is  also \\nre ected in our green. smart. and more. strategy.\\nThe  rst stage of the value chain is formed by the search for \\nand  evaluation  of  a  location,  followed  by  building  permit \\nand  zoning  issues.  The  next  step  is  the  development  and \\nplanning stage. After the necessary approvals are received \\nand the  nancing is secured, construction begins. General \\ncontractors, individual companies or a combination of both \\nserve as UBM s partners.\\nUBM concentrates on realisation in the form of forward sales \\nas early as the implementation phase. Due to UBM s strate-\\ngic transformation into a  Pure Play Developer , the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated   for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a  Pure Play Developer , UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.  The  main  service  pro-\\nviders  are  consultants,  for  example  architects,  building \\nphysicists, appraisers and structural engineering   in other \\nwords,  representatives  of  the  different   elds  required  for \\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E\\n\\nplanning.  The  transfer  of  a  project  to  realisation  involves \\nnew  partners:  either  a  general  contractor,  individual  com-\\npanies or a combination of both. Contractors and suppliers \\nare organised for various management duties after comple-\\ntion. The overriding principle: In the selection of its business \\npartners,  UBM  places  the  highest  priority  on  experience \\nfrom earlier business relationships, integrity and appropri-\\nate quali cations. There were no signi cant changes in the \\nsupply chain during 2021. \\n\\n2-6\\n\\n1.4.

At UBM, \\nthis  means  a  clear  strategic  focus  and  shared  values.  The \\nfoundation is created by a system of values that is based on \\nthree  pillars:  competent.  consequent.  transparent.  Speci -\\ncally, that means: UBM stands for high technical competence, \\nconsequent actions and full transparency.  \\n\\n2-9, 2-13, 2-19, 2-22\\n\\n13\\n\\n Martina Maly-G rtner (COO) , \\nThomas G.

Financial performance indicators\\n\\nBusiness development and earnings\\nWith after-tax pro t of  44m, UBM closed the 2021  nan-\\ncial  year  with  results  that  exceeded  expectations  at  the \\nstart  of  the  second  pandemic  year.  This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.  The  consequent  focus \\non green. smart. and more. also played an important role. \\nHowever,  successful  strategic  change  not  only  requires  a \\nsolid  nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever \\nbefore with an equity ratio of 37%.\\n\\nThis improvement was based primarily on property sales \\nin  Germany  and  Austria  as  well  as  the  progress  of  con-\\nstruction on previously sold real estate projects which are \\nrecognised over time in accordance with the progress of \\ncompletion and sale.\\n\\nThe  pro t  from  companies  accounted  for  at  equity  rose \\nto  36.0m in 2021 (2020:  27.8m). This improvement was \\nsupported, above all, by ongoing forward sold real estate \\nprojects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt. \\n\\nUBM  Development  generated  Total  Output  of   471.0m  in \\n2021, compared with  478.6m in the previous year. Of this \\ntotal,  371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The \\nlargest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-\\nmany and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the \\npre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output \\nfor the reporting year was also in uenced, above all, by the \\nprogress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-\\njects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-\\ncentage of completion and realisation. In this category, the \\nlargest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-\\ntial construction projects like the Gmunder H fe in Munich \\nand  the  Siebenbrunnengasse  in  Vienna,  a  project  with  \\n178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-\\nitive  contributions  were  made  by  the  forward  sold  F.A.Z. \\nTower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. \\n\\nEBITDA rose by  10.8m over the previous year to  75.9m \\nin 2021. Depreciation and amortisation declined by 14.8% \\nto   2.6m  (2020:   3.1m),  and  EBIT  consequently  rose \\nby   11.3m  to   73.3m  (2020:   62.0m).  Financial  income \\ndeclined from  23.9m in the previous year to  14.0m, and \\n nancial costs amounted to  27.2m (2020:  23.7m). There \\nwere no material deviations in  nancial costs during 2021 \\nor 2020.\\n\\nEBT  totalled   60.1m  in  2021  and  was   2.1m,  or  3.4%, \\nlower than the previous year (2020:  62.3m). Tax expense \\nequalled   16.4m,  compared  with   21.5m  in  2020,  and \\nrepresented a tax rate of 27.3% (2020: 34.5%). The lower \\ntax rate in the reporting year resulted from the tax effects \\nof equity-accounted results and a special effect from the \\nsale of a project in Austria. \\n\\nRevenue  as  reported  on  the  consolidated  income  state-\\nment  increased  by  51.8%  to   278.3m  (2020:   183.3m). \\n\\nPro t  for  the  period  (net  pro t  after  tax)  totalled   43.7m \\nin  2021  (2020:   40.8m).

Beginning with the \\n2020   nancial  year,  the  calculation  of  net  pro t  attribut-\\nable to the shareholders of the parent company includes \\na deduction for the share attributable to the hybrid capi-\\ntal holders; the comparative prior year data were adjusted \\naccordingly.  The  share  attributable  to  the  hybrid  capital \\nholders  rose  from   7.0m  to   8.6m  in  the  2021   nancial \\nyear following the issue of a new hybrid bond during the  \\nsecond quarter of 2021. The resulting earnings per share \\nrose from  4.39 to  4.50 in 2021.\\n\\nAsset and  nancial position\\nTotal assets recorded by the UBM Group rose by  122.4m \\nover  the  previous  year  to   1,494.5m  as  of  31  December \\n2021. This increase was supported, above all, by the issue \\nof  two  sustainability-linked  corporate  bonds  which  will \\nprovide added  nancial  exibility for business activities.\\n\\nNon-current assets declined slightly by  0.3m to  824.6m \\nat year-end 2021. Property, plant and equipment totalled \\n 12.9m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31  December  2020: \\n 11.6m).  This  position  consists  primarily  of  capitalised \\nrights of use from leases, which totalled  8.8m at the end \\nof 2021. \\n\\nCurrent assets rose by  122.8m over the level at year-end \\n2020  to   669.8m  as  of  31  December  2021.  This  increase \\nwas based primarily on a higher balance of cash and cash \\nreceivables, which grew by  176.1m to  423.3m. \\n\\nEquity  totalled   550.6m  as  of  31  December  2021  (31 \\nDecember  2020:   482.9m)  and  was  increased  primarily \\nby the issue of a hybrid bond and by earnings. The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30 35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was  nalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.  Nearly  50%  of  the \\n2018  hybrid  bond  was  redeemed  prematurely,  and  this \\n nancing was extended to 2026. \\n\\nBond  liabilities  totalled   526.5m  at  the  end  of  December \\n2021 and were  70.0m over the level at the end of the pre-\\nvious year (31 December 2020:  456.5m). A  7.0m bearer \\nbond  (term  2021 2025)  and  a  further   0.5m  bearer  bond \\n(term  2021 2025)  were  issued  in  the   rst  quarter  of  2021. \\nIn  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  UBM  issued  a  sustain- \\nability-linked bond (term: 2021 2026). The issue volume of \\n 150.0m included  68.9m from the exchange of the exist-\\ning  bond  2017 2022.  A  promissory  note  loan  and  bearer \\nbond (term: 2016 2021) were repaid in December 2021.\\n\\nNet  debt  was  substantially  lower  than  the  previous  year \\nat  381.0m as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \\n 479.1m).  This  indicator  represents  current  and  non-cur-\\nrent  bonds  and   nancial  liabilities,  excluding  lease  liabil-\\nities,  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The  decline  in  net \\ndebt  resulted,  above  all,  from  distributions  from  equity- \\naccounted  companies,  property  sales  and  an  increase  in \\n nancial liabilities as support for investments.\\n\\n2-6\\n\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAIL16\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM IN DETAILESG   which stands for Environment, Social, Governance   is an integral part  of our strategy.

This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans . Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate  nancing. Over the longer term, we also see  green bonds  as attrac-tive tools for green  nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speci c use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien f r Europas Metropolen.

As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our of ces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

The rel-\\nevance of the sustainability strategy and goals is evaluated \\nat regular intervals and suitable goal attainment measures \\nare defined. The Executive Committee frequently deals with \\nsustainability issues, especially in view of the new strategic \\nfocus on green. smart. and more. The Management Board \\nis included in central decisions and receives routine reports \\non progress.\\n\\nWith the help of a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, \\nConsulted, Informed), the roles and responsibilities for ESG \\nwere transparently defined and recorded. The investor rela-\\ntions  &  ESG  department  coordinates  sustainability  issues \\nwithin the framework of UBM s strategy and business model \\nand  is  in  charge  of  the  operative  ESG  reporting  together \\nwith the organisation of ESG ratings. Its activities include the \\nfurther development of the sustainability strategy, the defi-\\nnition and monitoring of goals, and the implementation of \\nmeasures together with selected specialist departments. This \\n\\ndepartment  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  changes  in \\nthe legal framework and serves as an information interface \\nfor the company. The head of investor relations & ESG and \\nthe Management Board communicate regularly on current \\ndevelopments and issues.\\n\\nThe  specialist  departments  and  countries  are  responsible \\nfor managing and implementing sustainability issues.

In  addition,  the \\nWorks Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Aus-\\ntrian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number \\nof members to the Supervisory Board. The Annual General \\nMeeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the \\nend of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple \\nmajority  of  the  votes  cast. The  Supervisory  Board  elects  a \\nchairman and one or more deputies from among its mem-\\nbers each year at a meeting held after the Annual General \\nMeeting. The Supervisory Board can form committees from \\namong its members, which can be established as permanent \\nbodies or for individual tasks.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected \\nby the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members \\ndesignated by the Works Council as employee representa-\\ntives. The table on the following page shows the members \\nelected to the Supervisory Board in 2019.

Gross risks were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n  Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n  Attractive employer & training and education\\n  Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n  UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n  The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n  The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact.

Conscious handling of risks and  \\n\\ntheir effects\\n\\nThe  realistic  assessment  and  management  of  risks  repre-\\nsent an essential factor for business success and sustainable \\nmanagement. One related step was the announcement in \\n2021 of UBM s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.). The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings (according to the respective national definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##3.6.1. Environmental risks\\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increas-\\ningly important for the planning and realisation of develop-\\nment projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir activities on the environment. Economic success and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success   and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce \\nenvironmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise \\nbusiness opportunities for UBM in this field.\\n\\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part \\nof the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn the course of general risk management, the probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance. The main goals are described on page \\n39, the details on page 50.

ESG reporting\\n\\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Aus-\\ntrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has \\nvoluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in \\nline with the latest GRI standards since 2020. Consequently, \\nthe company is very well prepared to address the information \\nrequirements at the product and corporate levels that will \\nresult from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. \\n\\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing \\nregulatory developments   for example, the materiality analy-\\nsis was revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). More-\\nover, UBM s reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and \\nnorms like the UN Global Compact (see section 3.9.). This \\nESG  report  serves  as  a  progress  report  for  the  UN  Global \\nCompact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD \\nrecommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures) since 2021 and is reporting on this subject in this \\nreport for the first time (see section 3.6.).\\n\\nIn connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the \\ncoming  years  which  were  set  in  2021,  the  ESG  report  is  a \\nvaluable management tool for UBM to meet its responsibil-\\nity  to  society.  The  ESG  report  describes  the  management \\napproaches, goals and measures related to the environment, \\nsociety and governance, and highlights successes as well as \\nchallenges. The subject areas are based on the materiality \\nanalysis carried out in 2021. The ESG report is prepared by \\nthe investor relations & ESG department in coordination with \\nthe specialist departments and released by the Management \\nBoard. Additional information on UBM, its business devel-\\nopment and corporate governance is provided in the 2021 \\nannual report.\\n\\nTransparency  and  reliability  are  also  decisive  for  our  ESG \\nreporting,  and  we  therefore  arranged  for  an  external  lim-\\nited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is \\nprovided on page 125). UBM also introduced a central data \\nmanagement tool in 2021 which will be successively filled \\nstarting in 2022. The goal is to create an informative basis \\nfor the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. \\nControlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, while \\ndata collection takes place directly in the respective areas \\nand departments in the individual countries.

UBM  has \\noffice space at 19 locations. Our goal in this area is to steadily \\nreduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach \\nthis goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see sec-\\ntion 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste man-\\nagement are also important issues for UBM and are internally \\nmanaged and reported. \\n\\n \\nFewer standing assets\\nThe  strategic  focus  of  UBM s  business  activities  includes \\nthe  development  and  sale  of  properties. Accordingly,  the \\nnumber of standing assets has been steadily reduced since \\n2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these \\nproperties   here, the key issue is whether the properties are \\nrented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on \\nenergy consumption and emissions, for example through the \\nuse of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling \\nsolutions.\\n\\n66\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.1.  Energy efficiency, renewable energies & \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n4.1.1. Importance of the issue \\nWith  the  Paris  Agreement,  nations  across  the  world  have \\nagreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially \\nbelow 2 C and, through further measures, to limit the increase \\nto 1.5 C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU Green \\nDeal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in \\nthis context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net green-\\nhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) by 2030 in the EU. This \\nimportant interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on \\ncourse to become the world s first climate-neutral continent \\nby 2050. Related activities include the European Commis-\\nsion s  Fit for 55  package which includes draft legislation in \\nthe areas of climate, energy and fuel, traffic, buildings, the use \\nof land and forestry operations. The requirements include, \\namong others, a European approach to CO2 pricing (certifi-\\ncate trading and CO2 taxes).\\n\\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy \\ncurrently focus, among others, on energy and emissions and \\nestablish stricter requirements for companies regarding cli-\\nmate protection measures and the related reporting. Invest-\\nments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxon-\\nomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as \\na decline in investor demand in the future. Various players \\n  including companies, investors, public institutions and con-\\nsumers   are called on to accept responsibility and support \\nthe attainment of these goals with effective measures.\\n\\n67\\n\\nThese  ambitious  goals  represent  a  challenge  for  the  real \\nestate sector because energy consumption and the related \\ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by buildings during their \\nentire  lifecycle  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  climate \\nfootprint. The construction and operation of real estate are \\nresponsible  for  nearly  40%  of  global  CO2  emissions    and \\nover  one  third  of  worldwide  energy  consumption  (UNEP \\n2020). The  real  estate  sector  therefore  plays  an  important \\nrole   reducing energy consumption and the CO2 emissions \\nof buildings are crucial for meeting the defined goals.\\n\\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valu-\\nable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emis-\\nsions: The examples of possible actions include renewable \\nenergies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic \\nor solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase \\nor  subsequent  refitting  and  options  for  the  expansion  of \\nrenewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells \\nand technology, low-energy and low-emission building mate-\\nrials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts \\n(e.g. e-charging stations).   GRI 3-3\\n\\n4.1.2. Our commitment  \\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently \\nneeded  living  space  for  society.  We  want  to  support  the \\nglobal agenda and attach great importance to environmen-\\ntally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented con-\\nstruction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be \\nsubstantially reduced, both during construction and in later \\nbuilding operations. Our focus is on low-emission building \\nmaterials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of \\nrenewable energies.\\n\\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction \\nare important because of their significant, inherent capability \\nto reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood \\nstores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the pro-\\nduction of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results \\nin CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel \\nfrequently used in building construction is responsible for \\nno  less  than  six  per  cent  of  all  CO2  emissions  worldwide. \\nConsequently, we evaluate the possible use of the renewa-\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ble material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for \\nevery project. Our goal here is to create significantly more \\nthan 100,000 square metres of office and residential space \\nin timber-hybrid construction by 2025.\\n\\nThe energy consumption in the buildings developed by UBM \\n(offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment \\nand is a material cost factor for tenants and users. As early \\nas  the  planning  phase,  the  energy  consumption  from  the \\nconstruction and operation of a building can be reduced. \\nEfficient measures include, among others, good insulation, \\nenergy-efficient building technology, location-based orien-\\ntation and the size of windows, shading equipment and the \\nenergy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and \\ncooling) with modern sensors.\\n\\nWe are working intensively  \\nto develop  smart  buildings  \\nthat ultimately consume less  \\nenergy and resources.\\n\\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or \\nheating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings \\n(geothermal power, photovoltaic and solar technology, etc.) \\ncan make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emis-\\nsions. This can also be achieved through subsequent refitting \\nor options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. \\nThe options for connecting to geothermal power and similar \\nsources, however, must be evaluated in selecting the location \\nand acquiring the site.\\n\\nOur  green.  smart.  and  more.  strategy  places  ESG  in  the \\nfocus of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply \\nanchored in processes and represents an integral part of all \\nphases.  Processes  are  operationally  standardised  through \\nan institutionalised 360  principle. More specifically: As part \\nof the  Next Level  efficiency programme, all core and sup-\\nport processes were reviewed on the basis of defined qual-\\nity gates and ultimately defined for the entire UBM Group. \\nThese processes were adapted in line with the strategic focus \\n\\non green. smart. and more. to ensure implementation of the \\nstrategy  at  project  level.  For  example:  Every  project  must \\ninclude an evaluation, among others, for the use of timber \\nas a building material, greening and the on-site generation \\nof renewable energy through photovoltaics   as only several \\nexamples of quality gates in our standardised Group-wide \\nprocesses. Additional information on the 360  process land-\\nscape can be found in section 6.\\n\\nFor new projects, we build with  \\ntimber and operate with renewable \\nenergy wherever possible.\\n\\nSustainability  certifications  are  a  suitable  measurement \\ninstrument to make building performance on the real estate \\nmarket  comparable     and  to  draw  conclusions  and  learn \\nfrom the results. For many years, we have actively, and based \\non our conviction, worked to achieve certification for our \\nproperties.  All  new  construction  projects  are  sustainably \\nplanned,  built  and  subject  to  a  sustainability  assessment \\nbased on the DGNB, LEED or BREEAM systems. UBM has \\nset a goal as part of its strategic reorientation to achieve \\ncertification not only for 100% of its commercial properties, \\nbut also for all new projects in the residential asset class   at \\nthe latest by 2025. \\n\\nAs a pure property developer, we work with a wide range \\nof  suppliers  and  service  providers.  Our  business  partners \\nare required to meet the same high standards, for example \\nstrict environmental requirements for suppliers  production \\nprocesses and building material components. Environmental \\nprotection is also anchored in the subcontractor statement \\n(further information can be found in section 6).\\n\\nThe focus on environmental aspects at our Group locations \\nis  also  increasing.  The  corporate  units  in  Austria  (AG  and \\nUBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are certified \\nunder  the  international  environmental  management  norm  \\nISO  14001  and  quality  management  norm  ISO  9001,  and \\nUBM Germany will be added to this list in 2022.

Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for \\nbuilding shells and the installation of energy-efficient tech-\\nnical equipment. The use of timber as a building material \\nmakes a special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.

We  calcu-\\nlate our emissions based on the internationally recognised \\nGreenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and  monitor  and  report  on  our \\nperformance.  One  challenge  in  this  respect  is  the  limited \\navailability  of  data  on  Scope  3  emissions,  i.e.  the  indirect \\nemissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw \\nmaterials and other products. In cases where there is a lack \\nof low-emission electricity, we have started to use certificates \\nas compensation for the unavoidable CO2 emissions arising \\nfrom electricity consumption in selected standing assets or \\nGroup locations. \\n\\nIn  order  to  be  optimally  positioned  for  the  future,  UBM \\nestablished the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) \\nin 2022. This non-profit foundation includes partners from \\nindustry  and  science  who  work  together  to  develop  tech-\\nnical applications for smart buildings.

These \\ntwo quality gates are part of the 360  principle described in \\nsection 4.1.2.\\n\\nUBM underscored its commitment to sustainable building \\nmaterials in the barany.7 residential construction project in \\nVienna, which was completed in 2021. A test will compare \\nthe different construction methods under the same condi-\\ntions.  One  of  the  seven  identical  buildings  was  built  as  a \\nwood structure, the rest according to the conventional solid \\nmethod. The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna \\nis accompanying the project with a study which will document \\nthe long-term advantages of wood construction in a direct, \\npractical comparison.\\n\\nThe positive experience from this Vienna project was also \\ntransferred to a much larger scale: The receipt of the build-\\ning permit in 2021 marked the start of construction of Tim-\\nber Pioneer, the first office building in Frankfurt to be build \\nin  timber-hybrid  construction. This  structure  (construction, \\nmaintenance, dismantling and disposal) will achieve a CO2 \\nreduction of roughly 12% compared with conventional con-\\n\\nstruction methods. UBM is handling the  embodied carbon , \\ni.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase \\nby using timber to reduce CO2 emissions from the building \\nmaterials.\\n\\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of \\nspecialists in the executing companies.

These surveys \\nprovide  the  basis  for  defining  concrete  targets  to  reduce \\nemissions. Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles \\nwhen new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also \\ninvolves the availability of suitable charging stations near the \\nemployee s home. In 2021, UBM s motor vehicle pool had 18 \\nvehicles with alternative drives.\\n\\nTravel\\n  Reduce CO2 in air travel by 25% (basis 2019) by 2025\\n\\nThe  Group-wide  travel  guideline   think  before  you  travel  \\nmakes clear that business trips should only be taken when \\nabsolutely necessary. Rail travel must be given preference \\nfor shorter distances, and video conference portals should be \\nused more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital \\nformats has increased substantially as a result of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.\\n\\nFor the UBM Day 2021, more than 200 of our colleagues from \\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and \\nAustria travelled to Vienna to experience our Group s commu-\\nnity  live . This event was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance \\nwith a long list of requirements including environmentally \\nfriendly travel, preferably with rail or public transportation. A \\nlimited number of the participants travelled via air due to the \\nlonger distances. UBM officially compensated for the result-\\ning emissions (in total, 2.982 tonnes of CO2) through support \\nfor the portfolio of Austrian climate protection projects. \\n\\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting \\nits Group locations to green electricity suppliers and equip-\\nping or refitting these facilities with building management \\nsystems to support energy optimisation. One challenge in \\nthis area is the availability of sustainable electricity. The share \\nof renewable energy in UBM s total energy consumption in \\n2021 equalled 25% in Austria, 28% in Germany, 13% for ALBA, \\n15% in Poland and 0% in the Czech Republic. CO2 certificates \\nwere purchased for the Group s location in Warsaw due to \\nthe lack of availability of green electricity to neutralise the \\nemissions from electricity consumption. In accordance with \\nthe GRI standards, this voluntary CO2 compensation does not \\nhave an impact on reported emissions. The contracts for all \\nlocations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland \\nwill be converted to green electricity, where available, at the \\nlatest in 2025. \\n\\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating sup-\\nplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national net-\\nworks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Ener-\\ngy-efficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations \\nare renovated.\\n\\nUBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in \\naccordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency \\nand Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Effi-\\nciency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All invest-\\nments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development \\nprojects) and locations are covered by these procedures. \\nAn external energy audit was carried out at the German and \\nAustrian  locations  in  2019,  and  verification  audits  based \\non ISO 50001 took place in Austria (AG and UBM Austria) \\nduring 2020 and 2001. ISO 50001 audits are scheduled for \\nGermany and Poland in 2022, and the Czech Republic will \\nfollow.\\n\\nAn important measure introduced by UBM in 2020 that will \\nbe expanded in the coming years is the transparent and more \\nexact collection of data on energy consumption and emis-\\nsions. This will support the development of further climate \\nprotection initiatives in the future.

GRI 3-3\\n\\nIn property development, the early planning phase defines \\nthe scope of the ecological footprint   and can be seen as \\nthe key to an efficient circular economy. Our focus on struc-\\ntural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their \\ndurability and their recycling capability.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  anchors,  among  others,  the  transition \\nto a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering the hazardous waste from con-\\nstruction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these \\nrequirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as \\nwell as a decline in investor demand in the future.\\n\\nThe  use  of  environmentally  friendly  and  durable  building \\nmaterials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental ben-\\nefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and the \\nlower consumption of resources. Timber, as a renewable raw \\nmaterial, stores carbon over the long term and is character-\\nised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity \\ncombined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost \\nbenefits through prefabrication and modular construction, \\nlower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased \\nspace through narrower wall construction. And last but not \\nleast, timber creates an excellent indoor climate: wood sur-\\nfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on \\nthe indoor climate.\\n\\nWith timber construction, we  \\nhave the largest lever in our  \\nhands as a real estate developer.\\n\\nThe production of steel and concrete, in particular, is CO2 \\nintensive,  and  these  materials  should  be  recycled  when \\na  building  is  demolished.  Later  recycling  capacity  can  be \\nactively included as early as the planning stage, for example \\n\\n74\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Work has also started to optimise CO2 emissions  over the \\nentire lifecycle for the Village im Dritten project in keeping \\nwith the focus on sustainability.  GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n4.3.  Ground sealing, climate change  \\n\\nadjustments and biodiversity \\n\\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the \\nlocal fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate   local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands)   and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.\\n\\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  requires,  among  others,  the  protection \\nof healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing \\nconstruction sites). Investments that lead to negative effects \\nfor the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvan-\\ntage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. \\nBuilding permits in Austria are granted under sustainability \\naspects which also include the issues of ground sealing and \\nbiodiversity. \\n\\nUBM s goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undevel-\\noped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground \\nsealing. Preference is given to development projects located \\nin urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are \\nembedded in an existing infrastructure.\\n\\nthrough the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber \\ncan be easily recycled   untreated wood can be reused or \\nrecycled,  while  dirtied  or  treated  wood  can  be  used  as  a \\nrenewable energy carrier. In this way, UBM supports recycling \\nin the sense of the circular economy. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nSustainable building materials & circular economy \\n  Evaluate the use of sustainable/recycled building  \\n\\nmaterials in all new development projects \\n\\n  Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling  \\n\\nfor all new development projects \\n\\nThe planning stage for all UBM projects must include and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials. Circular economy requirements are passed on to \\nthe planners.\\n\\nLifecycle  assessments  (see  section  4.1.2.)  are  used,  above \\nall, for building sections with massive components as well \\nas building sections with different lifecycles and renovation \\ncycles. The results of these lifecycle assessments help UBM to \\noptimise the selection of materials and component assembly \\nand make an important contribution to resource conservation, \\nthe reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return \\nto the materials cycle.\\n\\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing build-\\ning is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with \\nour green. smart. and more. strategy. Special attention is given \\nto recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtu-\\nally no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials \\nare separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is \\nplaced on the shortest possible transport routes to the recy-\\ncling location. And this effort really pays off: Nearly 95% of \\nall materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The \\nremaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and \\nthe like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with \\nlegal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded  Gold  \\ncertification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\\n\\n75\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM s value chain for real estate development begins with \\nan acquisition, or the purchase of a site. We never use land \\nin protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, the \\nrealisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with \\nintervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the \\ndestruction of free space, for example. UBM therefore focuses \\non so-called brownfield developments to avoid the conver-\\nsion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and \\nlimit ground sealing.\\n\\nIn addition to conscious interaction with the resource  land , \\nthe preservation of biological diversity is another important \\nconcern.

In \\ncomparison with demolition and subsequent new construc-\\ntion,  the  conversion  and  vitalisation  of  existing  buildings \\nresults in lower energy consumption and lower CO2 emis-\\nsions   an important ecological aspect that will also be taken \\ninto account in the future.

Healthy building materials &  \\n\\nthe quality of life  \\n\\nThe use of healthy building materials has a positive influence \\non the indoor climate in UBM s buildings and the comfort for \\nresidents, office tenants and hotel guests. The avoidance of \\nharmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhe-\\nsives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy \\nambiance for everyone involved. The EU Taxonomy includes, \\namong others, the avoidance and prevention of environmen-\\ntal pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in \\npaints, insulation, flooring, etc.). \\n\\n \\n \\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building \\ncertification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy build-\\ning materials. Timber is a particularly important product with \\nregard to living quality and aesthetics: Timber surfaces equal-\\nise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the \\nindoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to \\nits pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n78\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.6.  Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the  green and clean  motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##80\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 80\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##81\\n\\n48UBM & SOCIAL 8049UBM & SOCIAL 5.

We are well \\naware that we change and influence the living environment \\nof people with every real estate development project. That \\ncreates a responsibility which we actively accept. Our goal is, \\nwherever possible, to establish a constructive dialogue with \\nneighbouring residents and relevant interest groups in the \\nareas surrounding the projects and to make an improvement \\nthrough our activities. This added value and neighbourhood \\nvitalisation also benefit the project over the long-term.\\n\\nAccordingly, we have defined focal points in the following \\nareas:\\n\\n  Architecture, urban quarter development and  \\n\\nsocial diversity\\n\\n  Infrastructure & mobility\\n  Customer orientation and awareness creation\\n\\nWe are well aware that we  \\nchange and influence the living  \\nenvironment of people with every  \\nreal estate development project.\\n\\n5.1.1. Importance of the issue  \\nQualified and motivated employees are an important factor \\nfor our company s long-term success. Attracting and retaining \\nthese women and men calls for an environment in which per-\\nsonal development is possible and community is supported. \\n\\nThe understanding of work, above all by younger talents, is \\nundergoing  a  paradigm  shift  which  has  been  accelerated \\nby the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid \\nincrease in digitalisation. Values like purpose, the work-life \\nbalance and creative opportunities are becoming more and \\nmore important.\\n\\nNew work structures include, above all, greater flexibility for \\nworking hours and locations. However, a functioning remote \\nwork culture can never completely replace the office with its \\nspontaneous interpersonal contacts, inspiring coincidence, \\nand  sharing  and  shaping.  Offices  will,  consequently,  not \\nbecome irrelevant, but the requirements will change: That is \\nwhere a company becomes visible, that is where community \\nbecomes real. The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study  The State of Skills 2021  shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems at several levels over the long term. Employees \\nwith insufficient expertise will be unable to carry out their \\nactivities at a higher quality level   and when confidence in \\ntheir own abilities is low, work is perceived as more stressful, \\nassignments take longer, and both quality and motivation \\ndecline.  Training  and  education  therefore  create  benefits \\n\\n82\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##for the employee as well as the employer. Expanding know-\\nhow and skills, retaining this expertise in the company, and \\nsupporting innovation by employees guarantees quality and \\nsatisfaction for everyone involved.\\n\\nA greater risk for companies is the inability to find, develop \\nand  retain  sufficient  specialists  and  managers.  A  lack  of \\nopportunities can lead to lower employee motivation and \\nproductivity. That, in turn, can increase employee turnover, \\nrecruiting costs and the loss of know-how in the company. \\n\\nIn the competition for qualified employees, positioning as an \\nattractive employer is decisive. The basis is formed by com-\\npliance with the respective national laws governing employ-\\nment and working conditions as a minimum standard as well \\nas consideration for other frameworks like the recommen-\\ndations of the International Labour Organisation. Employers \\nmust respect human rights, reject child labour and forced \\nlabour, and support the freedom of association, among oth-\\ners, and can also influence the following subject areas: fair \\ncompensation, safe and healthy working conditions, and the \\nrejection of any form of discrimination.\\n\\nUnattractive working conditions can damage a company s \\nreputation, appeal to neither young professionals nor expe-\\nrienced experts, and significantly limit access to the labour \\nmarket. News of bad experience with employers in online \\napplication platforms or social media can also be expected to \\nspread rapidly. In the end, the company s positioning on the \\nmarket will be weakened with an increasing risk that potential \\nemployees may wander to the competition.   GRI  3-3\\n\\n5.1.2. Our commitment  \\nWe  owe  our  success  to  our  talented,  committed  employ-\\nees who take on individual responsibility and want to play \\nan active role in designing UBM s success. UBM supports its \\nemployees in reaching their personal career goals and offers \\nthem opportunities for personal growth, diverse training and \\ndevelopment possibilities and numerous benefits.\\n\\nWith our values   competent. consequent. transparent.   we \\ncreate a working climate in which each person feels included, \\n\\nauthorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. \\nWe encourage our employees to be proactive through short \\ndecision paths and flat hierarchies.\\n\\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict com-\\npliance with the national and international rules and require-\\nments in the markets where we are active. We also base our \\nactions  on  agreements  that  include  the  Universal  Declara-\\ntion of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the \\ninternational labour standards set by the International Labour \\nOrganisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This \\ncommitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code \\nand code of conduct for business partners, see section 6.1.).\\n\\nModern workplace & community\\nOpen communications are a central element of our corpo-\\nrate values and an important building block for our attractive-\\nness as an employer. At all our locations, we create working \\nspaces that support interaction, creativity, and the health and \\nperformance of our employees. The headquarters in Vienna, \\nfor example, include a lounge with table football and darts \\nas well as a green inner courtyard and roof terrace with a \\nbarbecue area. Specially created  new work zones  serve as \\nmultifunctional work areas and give the office a new standing \\nas a communication and collaboration platform. \\n\\nOur Group-wide UBM Day, which is held every two years, \\nsupports the exchange of information and an open corporate \\nculture across business areas and national borders. In addi-\\ntion to company outings or Christmas parties, we organise \\nevents like barista workshops and joint participation in sport \\nevents to promote teambuilding.\\n\\nWork-life balance\\nWe believe it is important to help our employees establish \\na healthy work-life balance and to reconcile their work and \\nfamily life. Individual working time models are part of our \\nefforts in this area. Rules are in place, and formalised in the \\ncompany agreement, to permit nursing leave for close family \\nmembers. Employees have access to special time off under \\ncertain circumstances and, of course, all employees are enti-\\ntled to parental leave.\\n\\n83\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Open communications are a central \\nelement of our corporate values and  \\nan important building block for our \\nattractiveness as an employer.\\n\\nPerformance-based remuneration\\nWith very attractive salary packages and regular bonuses that \\nare tied to individual performance and annual results, UBM \\nemployees participate in the company s success.\\n\\nBenefits\\nAdditional benefits include, among others, the reimburse-\\nment of costs for environmentally friendly mobility like sub-\\nsidies for public transportation as well as a daily lunch allow-\\nance.

Moreover, there are signs that the legal requirements \\ngoverning equal opportunities will be strengthened in the \\nfuture.\\n\\nFair  treatment  of  our  employees  and  a  culture  of  mutual \\nrespect and appreciation are obvious at UBM. We treat all \\nemployees equally   regardless of their ethnic, national or \\nsocial background, disabilities, sexual orientation, political or \\nreligious conviction, gender, family status or age, economic \\nor other standing.

Health and safety\\n\\nWork absences can result in financial damages, the loss of \\nknow-how and productivity declines. In office settings, health \\nand injury risks primarily involve ergonomic and psycholog-\\nical aspects. (Chronic) illnesses due to incorrect or non-ex-\\nistent ergonomics in work equipment can lead to increased \\nsickness rates over the longer term. Construction sites are \\nassociated with health and injury risks, among others through \\nsevere or fatal accidents. These accidents have a direct neg-\\native effect on employees, but also mean additional admin-\\nistrative costs, work delays, rising project costs and/or legal \\nconsequences for the employer. \\n\\nOur  business  success  is  based  to  a  significant  degree  on \\nthe  commitment  and  motivation  of  our  employees. As  an \\nemployer,  we  also  feel  responsible  for  their  physical  and \\npsychological health. \\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\n  Hold lost time due to work accidents at a low level   \\n\\ngoal: zero work accidents \\n\\n  Protect and promote employees  health\\n\\nAs a real estate developer, support for employees  physical \\nand psychological health in everyday office routines plays a \\ncentral role at UBM (e.g. through stress prevention, an occu-\\npational  physician,  in-house  fitness  rooms).  A  major  focal \\npoint  for  construction  sites  involves  occupational  safety \\nmeasures (e.g. accident prevention, acoustic/heat protection \\nincluding training).\\n\\nUBM has implemented an integrated management system to \\nsupport occupational health and safety. It covers all employ-\\nees and meets the highest standards. The Group units in Aus-\\ntria (AG and UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are \\ncertified under the internationally recognised occupational \\nhealth and safety management norm ISO 45001, and certifi-\\ncation will be extended to UBM Germany in 2022. \\n\\nOccupational safety management includes experts like occu-\\npational physicians, specialists for occupational safety and \\nemployee representatives in line with national requirements. \\nSafety-related supervision is assigned to a specialist who eval-\\nuates, among others, potential dangers and carries out safety \\ninspections. Written instructions anchor occupational safety \\nthroughout the company and ensure compliance with high \\nsafety standards.\\n\\nThe success of these measures is reflected in the number \\nof work accidents, which has been extremely low for many \\nyears. There were no reportable work accidents and no acci-\\ndents with fatal or serious injuries in 2021. Moreover, no work- \\nrelated illnesses were recorded.\\n\\nIn addition to strict safety measures, UBM places high pri-\\nority on employees  health. The related measures include, \\namong others, the creation of ergonomic workplaces and \\nthe  opportunity  to  individually  use  the  in-house  fitness \\nrooms. Outdoor athletes can join the  UBM-Express  and \\ntake part in various running events. An occupational physi-\\ncian is also available to assist employees at UBM s Vienna \\nlocation.

Architecture, urban quarter development \\n\\nand social diversity  \\n\\nThe coming decades will bring a demographic shift towards \\nan ageing and more multinational society. The growing eco-\\nlogical demands on UBM buildings will, in turn, be increased \\nto also include social aspects. Today s development projects \\nshould reflect smart, low-barrier/barrier-free and flexible liv-\\ning and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow s users. \\nThe  failure  to  include  carefully  thought-out  architectural \\nconcepts for buildings and urban development projects can \\nresult in cost-intensive subsequent refitting to meet the needs \\nof the future.\\n\\nA balanced social and cultural mixture of residents forms the \\nbasis for the sustainable development of residential areas. \\nSmart architecture can increase the quality of the social ben-\\nefits as well as the attractiveness and accessibility of buildings \\nfor users and neighbouring residents. The creation of recrea-\\ntional and common rooms and shared spaces also increases \\nthe quality of life in the surrounding area.\\n\\nOur many years of experience as a real estate developer \\nhave taught us that development means change and inter-\\naction. One of our key principles is to always consider and \\nintegrate the socio-cultural environment in our projects. For \\nus, that means designing projects to minimise the poten-\\ntial negative effects on the local area, for example caused \\nby  shading,  artificial  light,  noise,  emission  and  increased \\ntraffic, or to more than offset these effects through positive \\nchanges and improvements. The health and well-being of \\nlater users is the focal point of the socio-cultural aspects in \\nproject development. Included here, for example, are room \\ntemperature, construction acoustics, noise emissions and the \\noptical design.\\n\\nTo make these phrases come alive, our approach includes \\nsustainability certificates like DGNB and  GNI as key meas-\\nurement and control instruments. Evaluation is based on the \\nthree-pillar principle of sustainability: economy, ecology and \\nsociety. Many UBM projects have already received these cer-\\ntificates (see section 4.1.), and our goal is to achieve sustain- \\nability certification over the long term for all our projects, also \\nin the residential asset class.\\n\\nOur projects create living and working space that influences \\nthe health and well-being of future residents and users. UBM \\ntherefore places high priority on the ecological assessment of \\nthe building materials used and the integration of the demo-\\ngraphic shift in its construction projects.\\n\\nUBM is committed to meeting all applicable legal and nor-\\nmative requirements on its buildings. But our claim goes far \\nbeyond that: We always want to exceed legal requirements \\nwhenever this is important to future users.\\n\\nThe following key aspects for the functionality of buildings \\nrepresent the standard for UBM in planning and realising its \\nreal estate projects:\\n\\n  Accessibility\\n  Absence of pollutants and construction ecology\\n  Indoor climate and acoustics\\n  Security \\n  Visual comfort (look & feel)\\n\\nUBM  sees  building  certification     through  its  continuous \\ndevelopment and adaptation to meet new market demands \\nand trends   as an important tool to make sure its projects are \\nfit for the future. Every project is designed to meet the green. \\nsmart. and more. strategy and is subsequently validated with \\nestablished  certification  systems  during  the  planning  and \\nconstruction phase.

Infrastructure and mobility  \\n\\nThe steady increase in traffic is one of the greatest challenges \\nfor municipal planning and development. Modern mobility \\nconcepts are, as a result, becoming more important in real \\nestate planning and the design of urban quarters.\\n\\nSustainable buildings require an integrated view of the usage \\nconcept   for the specific building and for its urban quarter. \\nThat also includes the surrounding economic and social infra-\\nstructure (e.g. shops, schools, workplaces, recreational areas) \\nas well as sustainable mobility concepts (car/bike sharing, \\ne-mobility). Connections to public transportation, in particu-\\nlar, create shorter traffic routes and increase the quality of \\nliving, working and hotel stays.\\n\\nUBM has accepted this challenge and, for example, devel-\\noped  a  future-oriented  mobility  concept  for  the  Timber \\nPioneer project in Frankfurt am Main. The goal is to reduce \\nthe use of private combustion vehicles for conventional des-\\ntination and origin transportation. The following offering is \\ndesigned to facilitate the changeover to more environmen-\\ntally friendly means of transport for the Timber Pioneer build-\\ning users:\\n\\n  E-charging stations for cars and charging facilities for \\n\\ne-bike batteries \\n\\n  Car sharing with hybrid and/or e-vehicle\\n  E-bike hire stations\\n  Additional bicycle storage areas\\n  Sophisticated bicycle infrastructure, including showers \\n\\nand changing rooms for users as well as a self-repair \\npoint \\n\\nSome  of  these  services,  for  example  car  sharing  and  the \\ne-bike hire stations, can also be used by the employees in \\nthe neighbouring F.A.Z. Tower   which creates excellent and \\nefficient synergies for both buildings.\\n\\nAt the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, tenants and owners will be \\nable to use e-charging stations in the office and residential \\nareas as well as a mobility point with car and bike sharing \\nproducts.   \\n\\nThe Poleczki Business Park, a UBM standing asset in Poland, \\nis  currently  carrying  out  a   manage  to  green   project  that \\ninvolves  the  refitting  of  two  buildings  to  include  parking \\nspaces with e-charging stations. If the test phase is successful, \\ne-charging stations will be installed in up to 30% of all parking \\nspaces in the business park.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\n5.6.  Customer orientation and  \\n\\nawareness raising  \\n\\nA focus on the needs of (future) residents and users leads \\nto longer satisfaction and can help to reduce conflicts and \\ncomplaints. Customer orientation measures can include the \\nearly involvement of relevant stakeholders, consideration for \\nimportant issues raised by different social groups, or conflict \\nmanagement  processes.  The  creation  of  a  greater  aware-\\nness of sustainability issues can also improve users  sense \\nof  well-being.  Insufficient  or  a  complete  lack  of  customer \\norientation  can  lead  to  declining  revenues,  market  access \\nproblems and lower corporate profitability.\\n\\nUBM wants to create attractive quarters that contribute to \\nsustainable urban development and create benefits for the \\ngeneral public. These quarters must be resistant against com-\\ning climate changes to also allow for a high quality of life in \\nthe future.\\n\\n89\\n\\nUBM & SOCIAL\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The  development  of  an  urban  quarter  means  much  more \\nthan  just  planning  and  constructing  a  building.  Many  dif-\\nferent  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  these  activities, \\nincluding  project  developers,  planners,  public  authorities \\nand district administrators as well as neighbouring residents, \\nand  the  complexity  is  accordingly  high.  We  involve  rele-\\nvant stakeholder groups in our planning and development \\nprocesses through early information, participation and co- \\ndetermination rights. That allows neighbouring residents to \\nexpress their needs and interests and influence results. This \\napproach has been embedded in UBM s process landscape \\nas the standard since 2021.\\n\\nWe involve relevant stakeholder \\ngroups in our planning and  \\ndevelopment processes at an early \\nstage through information, participa-\\ntion and co-determination rights.\\n\\nIn this way, initial reservations by a citizens  initiative concern-\\ning a possible increase in the traffic load near the Gmunder \\nH fe in Munich were successfully dispelled. The goal for this \\nproject     and  for  all  other  UBM  developments     is  to  also \\ncreate an optimal usage mix for the city. In addition to attrac-\\ntive residential units with parking spaces, day-care centres, \\ngreen and open areas available for public use, other benefits \\ninclude the nearby recreational area along the River Isar and \\ngood public transportation connections via underground and \\nrapid transit railway.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna is a further example of suc-\\ncessful participative urban development. This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens  concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone   an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n  is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and \\nshared activities, the use of a quarter management app is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases and improves the value of the area surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years   also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard ( Sustainable Corporate Governance ) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability. Planned regulations (among others, CSRD, \\nEU Taxonomy) will require companies in the EU not only to \\nmeet but also to monitor, comply and expand on this type of \\ntransparency.

We are committed to the ten principles of the UN \\nGlobal Compact which, for example, prohibit child labour \\nand forced labour. Our codes of conduct (ethic code and \\ncode of conduct for business partners) require guarantees \\nfor fair compensation, workplace safety, support for equal \\nopportunity and the freedom of association, for example.\\n\\nOur responsible and transparent management is based on \\nthe following cornerstones:\\n\\nAustrian Code of Corporate Governance\\nUBM,  as  an  international  listed  company,  has  pledged  its \\ncommitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, a \\nvoluntary guideline for good management and control. The \\ncompany has also issued rules of conduct in the form of inter-\\nnal guidelines to ensure transparent and exemplary actions.\\n\\nCompliance Management System\\nThe compliance management system implemented by UBM \\nis intended to minimise the risk of a potential violation of legal \\nregulations and ensure adherence to all framework condi-\\ntions. A compliance management system manual details the \\nresponsibilities and powers of the compliance organisation \\nas well as the processes which implement the related rules \\nand  guidelines.  The  Management  Board  and  Supervisory \\nBoard consider it their responsibility to guarantee the con-\\nsequent implementation of all compliance principles. Our \\napproach follows the principle of prevention   disclosure   \\nreaction, whereby the focus is on the prevention of incorrect \\nbehaviour.\\n\\nThe trust of employees, business partners, customers and \\nother stakeholders is strengthened by UBM s focus on trans-\\nparency,  anti-corruption,  fair  business  practices,  the  pre-\\nvention of money laundering and data protection. Internal \\nguidelines and work instructions form the framework for the \\nnecessary procedures   examples are:\\n\\nConsequent compliance with applicable national and inter-\\nnational legal norms as well as our ethical principles safe-\\nguards the trust of our stakeholders. We are non-partisan and \\ndo not make any donations to political parties.\\n\\nGuideline: Cartel and Competition Law  \\nAgreements and coordinated actions with third-party com-\\npanies  that  lead  to     or  aim  to  lead  to     the  restriction  of \\ncompetition are prohibited and will not be tolerated by UBM. \\n\\nGuideline: Anti-corruption \\nUBM  employees  are  prohibited,  without  exception,  from \\naccepting  or  granting  monetary  gifts.  Material  gifts  to \\nemployees of public organisations are also prohibited with-\\nout exception. Small invitations and gifts can represent part \\nof international business customs or cultural practices and \\n\\n95\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##are only permitted under strictly regulated circumstances and \\nonly in connection with employees of non-public organisa-\\ntions.\\n\\nagreement with Art. 32 of the MAR, appropriate protection is \\ngiven to persons who report violations and persons who are \\naccused of violations as well as their personal data.\\n\\nWork instructions: Signatures\\nAll correspondence with a legally or commercially binding \\ncontent as well as orders for goods or services must, in prin-\\nciple, be signed by two persons (dual control principle) who \\nare specifically authorised or designated.\\n\\nGuideline  for  the  prevention  of  money  laundering  and \\nterrorism  financing  and  work  instructions:  Prevention  of \\nMoney Laundering \\nBefore a business relationship begins, its purpose and the \\nidentity of the business partner or ownership structure for \\nlegal entities must be precisely identified and regularly mon-\\nitored. The principle here is  know your customer .\\n\\nWork instructions: Data Maintenance 360 \\nData maintenance and consequent data entry are essential \\nfor the correct performance of our systems. Further informa-\\ntion on the 360  process landscape can be found on page 97.\\n\\nGuideline: Conflicts of Interest  \\nUBM employees must make sure their own interests do not \\ncome into conflict with their professional obligations or coun-\\nter UBM s obligations towards its business partners.  \\n\\nUBM operates a whistleblowing system as defined in Art. 32 of \\nthe EU s Market Abuse Directive ( MAR ) which allows employ-\\nees and external persons to report irregularities and (potential) \\nviolations of this regulation. Reports can be submitted directly to \\na staff member in the compliance organisation or sent by email to  \\ncompliance@ubm-development.com or anonymously via the \\nlink https://secureveal.ubm-development.com. The reporting \\nof potential violations is in the interest of the Management \\nBoard as well as the management of the Group companies. In \\n\\nData protection\\nUBM is committed to the confidential and responsible handling  \\nof personal data in agreement with the applicable data pro-\\ntection laws   above all the EU Data Protection Regulation and \\nrelated national legislation. Secure handling is guaranteed \\nby a data protection manual that includes rules for internal \\ndata  processing,  work  procedures  and  their  monitoring.  \\nRegular  employee  training  and  surveys  create  a  greater \\nawareness of this sensitive issue and make sure data protec-\\ntion does not drift out of focus.\\n\\nEthics code\\nA separate, binding ethics code forms the basis for all busi-\\nness activities and decisions. It is the foundation for moral, \\nethical and legally compliance behaviour by all UBM employ-\\nees and is designed to prevent mistakes.\\n\\nThe values and principles contained in the code are based \\non national and international laws and requirements and on \\nagreements like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\nthe  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  the  United \\nNations Guidelines (above all the Guiding Principles on Busi-\\nness and Human Rights), the OECD Guidelines for Multina-\\ntional Enterprises, and the international labour standards set \\nby the International Labour Organisation (in particular the \\nFundamental Principles of the IAO). \\n\\nThe subject areas covered by the ethics code include, among \\nothers, bribery and corruption, fair competition, fundamen-\\ntal  and  human  rights,  working  conditions,  occupational \\nsafety and health, environmental protection, the prevention \\nof  money  laundering,  and  data  protection.  This  code  has \\nbeen expressly agreed in writing with all employees in their \\n\\n96\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##national  language  since  2021  and  is  regularly  adapted  to \\nreflect developments in the social and regulatory environ-\\nment as well as ethic values. The last update was completed \\nin December 2021.\\n\\nFurther information on the ethics code can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item  ESG . \\n\\nCode of conduct for business partners\\nWe not only place high priority on responsible actions by all \\nUBM employees, but also set high standards for our busi-\\nness partners. A separate code of conduct for our business \\npartners is firmly anchored in our corporate processes and \\nregularly adapted to reflect developments in the business \\nand regulatory environment and in fundamental ethic val-\\nues. The latest update was finalised in December 2021 and \\nincluded requirements for all business partners to strengthen \\nthe integration of ecological and social responsibility along \\nthe entire value chain.\\n\\nThis code is based on the same principles and regulations as \\nthe ethics code and covers issues like bribery and corruption, \\nfair  competition,  fundamental  and  human  rights,  working \\nconditions,  occupational  safety  and  health,  environmental \\nprotection, the prevention of money laundering, and data \\nprotection. The code of conduct applies to all business part-\\nners who sell their products or services to UBM. If a business \\npartner refuses to sign the code of conduct, any negotiated \\ncontracts will not be signed and the compliance officer is \\nimmediately informed. He will then decide   together with the \\nManagement Board   on further procedures. In the event the \\ncode is violated, UBM reserves the right to undertake suitable \\nmeasures at any time which, in the end, can lead to suspen-\\nsion or immediate termination of a contract relationship with \\nthe business partner. \\n\\nFurther information on the code of conduct for business part-\\nners can be found on our website under the menu item  ESG .\\n\\nWorks Council  \\nUBM has a Works Council with five members who are elected \\nevery four years. Four of these members are delegated to \\nthe Supervisory Board, where they make up one third of the \\nvotes.\\n\\nUBM supports the freedom of association as defined by the \\nrespective national frameworks as well as representation on \\nthe Supervisory Board. The Works Council also takes part in \\ncollective negotiations in line with legal regulations and with \\nUBM s  approval. The  newly  founded  ESG  Committee  also \\nincludes one member from the Works Council.\\n\\nDuring the 2021 financial year, there were no threats to or \\nviolations of the above-mentioned freedoms for UBM s oper-\\nating locations or suppliers.\\n\\nTransparent processes \\nUBM has implemented a variety of rules and processes which \\ngo beyond legal requirements. These processes are opera-\\ntionally standardised through an institutionalised 360  prin-\\nciple. More specifically: As part of the  Next Level  efficiency \\nprogramme, all core and support processes for project devel-\\nopment were reviewed on the basis of defined quality gates \\nand  ultimately  defined  for  the  entire  company.  Roles  and \\nresponsibilities were clearly assigned in these processes, and \\nthe control mechanisms were revised and improved. These \\nprocedures  and  rules  give  employees  the  corresponding \\ntools to perform their jobs and support the efficient design \\nof processes and controls. \\n\\n97\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##We  are  convinced  that  these  types  of  work  instructions, \\nguidelines and models create transparency, facilitate com-\\nmunication and documentation, and help to make processes \\nmore efficient. They also make effective controls possible.\\n\\nUBM has taken the necessary precautions to ensure compli-\\nance with legal and internal guidelines, on the one hand, and \\nto quickly identify and correct any weak points in business \\nand organisational processes, on the other hand.\\n\\nThe internal control system and internal audit \\nOur internal control system (ICS) is an integral part of our \\nbusiness processes. The most important goals of this control \\nsystem are to:\\n\\n  Monitor compliance with business policies  \\n\\nand defined goals\\n\\n  Safeguard the company s assets \\n  Guarantee the reliability of accounting and reporting\\n  Maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of  \\n\\nbusiness processes\\n\\n  Identify risks at an early point in time\\n  Reliably assess potential risks\\n  Monitor compliance with legal requirements\\n  Ensure the efficient use of resources and cost savings \\n\\nIn addition to the controls in core processes, UBM has installed \\ncommercial and technical controlling functions. Both report \\ndirectly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling \\nmonitors the ongoing development of business to identify \\ndeviations from targets and, if there are any deviations, makes \\ncertain  management  receives  the  necessary  information. \\nTechnical  controlling  monitors  project  development  with \\na focus on schedules, construction costs, construction pro-\\ngress and all processes important for technical realisation.  \\nGRI 2-15, 2-23, 2-25, 2-26, 3-3, 205-2, 407-1\\n\\n6.1.3. Organisational structure  \\nCompliance management at UBM is installed in the legal, \\ncorporate and compliance department, which is also respon-\\nsible for the content of the related guidelines. A compliance \\nofficer  and  deputy  were  appointed  by  the  Management \\nBoard of UBM AG. The compliance guidelines are prepared \\nby the compliance officer in coordination with the Manage-\\nment Board and communicated to all employees. All UBM \\nemployees have digital access to these guidelines. \\n\\nThe compliance officer monitors adherence to the guidelines \\nand is also responsible for regular updates to meet changes \\nin legal regulations. The compliance guidelines are reviewed \\nannually by the compliance officer. Risk analyses, reviews and \\ninternal audits form the basis for continuous monitoring of \\nthe compliance management system. \\n\\nThe key positions in the internal data protection organisation \\nare the data protection coordinator and one data protection \\nofficer in each country who are all appointed by the Manage-\\nment Board. The data protection guideline calls for the instal-\\nlation of a data breach response team for the management \\nand reporting of data protection violations in agreement with \\nthe data protection guideline.\\n\\nA  money  laundering  officer  has  also  been  appointed.  As \\npart of KYC reviews ( know your customer ), he compares \\nthe data received with sanction lists, entries in the register \\nof economic owners, etc. Additional information on the KYC \\nreviews can be found on page 100.\\n\\nThe respective organisational units implement the individual \\ninternal guidelines and work instructions. For example: The \\nmanaging directors of the country organisations are respon-\\nsible for the operational implementation and control of work \\ninstructions related to the code of conduct and ethics code.\\n\\n98\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The quality management department is responsible for pro-\\ncedural instructions and documents related to the 360  pro-\\ncess landscape as well as the coordination of and support \\nfor regular audits and confirmation through ISO certificates.  \\nGRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3\\n\\nSupervisory Board self-evaluation\\nThe Supervisory Board carried out a self-evaluation of the  \\nefficiency of its activities, above all the organisation and work-\\ning procedures, during 2021 in accordance with C-Rule 36 of \\nthe Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.\\n\\n6.1.4.

We have implemented the following measures to support \\nthis approach and anchor these principles in our company.\\n\\nThere were no confirmed cases of corruption, proven money \\nlaundering incidents or other violations of rules and regu-\\nlations that would have led to fines or non-monetary sanc-\\ntions in 2021 or 2020. Furthermore, there were no confirmed \\ncases where contracts with business partners were cancelled \\nor not extended due to violations involving corruption, and \\nno confirmed cases that led to the termination or warning of \\nemployees due to corruption. There were no proceedings \\nfor anticompetitive behaviour, and no awareness of discrim-\\nination incidents.  \\n\\nWhistleblower system\\nThe whistleblower system was expanded in 2021 to cover \\nviolations of data protection regulations and other report-\\nable incidents in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1937. \\nIt will be further extended in 2022 to include other reports \\nin connection with UBM s ethics code and made available in \\nCzech and Polish.\\n\\n99\\n\\nQuality management system\\nISO  9001  certification  is  intended  to  make  sure  the  pro-\\ncess-oriented quality management system is based on the \\nhighest standards. The corporate units in Austria (UBM AG \\nand UBM Austria), the Czech Republic and Poland are cer-\\ntified  under  the  international  quality  management  norm  \\nISO 9001 and UBM Germany will be added in 2022. This cer-\\ntification covered 62% of UBM s workforce in 2021.\\n\\nRemuneration model\\nThe possible integration of ESG in the remuneration model \\nwill be examined more closely: ESG KPIs will be integrated in \\nmanagement s variable remuneration over the medium term. \\n\\nImplement guidelines and prevent misconduct by \\nconsequent preventive activities\\nEmployee training  \\nThe goal of training is to create a greater awareness among \\nemployees  for  potential  sources  of  risk  and,  in  this  way, \\nprevent  corruption  and  anti-competitive  behaviour.  New \\nemployees  receive  training  from  the  compliance  depart-\\nment immediately after they join UBM. Regular e-learning \\nprogrammes cover compliance with guidelines on different \\nsubjects  like  the  anti-corruption  guideline  and  the  guide-\\nline on antitrust and competition law, which are intended to \\nensure transparent and fair market behaviour by employees, \\nand the conflict of interest guideline as well as the issuer com-\\npliance guideline to prevent market abuse.\\n\\nMost of the classroom training on compliance regulations \\nhas been converted to virtual programmes since March 2020 \\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 174 employee \\ntraining courses (in-house and via e-learning) on compliance \\nissues (with a focus on capital market compliance and money \\nlaundering) were held in 2021. The training documents were \\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##reworked and, in particular, expanded to include current case \\nexamples.  \\n\\nThe compliance team frequently visits training courses, and \\nthere are additional certifications for selected responsibilities \\n(for example, the deputy compliance officer is also certified \\nas a compliance officer under ISO 19600).\\n\\nThe  procedure  for  the  distribution  of  relevant  corporate \\nguidelines to new employees will be revised in 2022. Employ-\\nees  will  be  notified  separately  of  any  relevant  changes  in \\nexisting guidelines.\\n\\nEthics code\\nThe ethics code is agreed in writing with all new employees \\nin their national language. It was adapted in 2021 to meet \\nour sustainability requirements and to strengthen the inte-\\ngration of ecological and social responsibility: For example, \\nthe focus on human rights and environmental protection was \\nreinforced. Increased awareness of the importance of ESG \\nis also supported by company events and training (like the \\nClimate Impact Day, internal courses, projects based on the \\ngreen. smart. and more. initiative) as well as targeted internal \\ncommunication.\\n\\nSampling controls of insider information\\nThe compliance team carries out sampling controls to mon-\\nitor compliance with the rules for the distribution of insider \\ninformation and confidential and price-sensitive information. \\nAdditional clarification briefings are held if necessary.\\n\\nPrevent money laundering and terrorism financing\\nKYC review of new business partners\\nKnow your customer is one of the basic principles underly-\\ning the guideline for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing and the work instructions on money \\nlaundering prevention. Full transparency is guaranteed by \\nrequiring all UBM contract partners to sign an appropriate \\ndisclosure form. Special focus is placed on transactions and \\nthe acquisition and sale of apartments. More stringent due \\ndiligence requirements are connected, among others, with \\ntransactions involving a greater inherent risk in the sense of \\nthe guideline on the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing, e.g. for offshore companies, high-risk \\ncountries and contracts with politically exposed persons. \\nThe money laundering officer uses special procedures to \\nreview all transactions with an increased risk of money laun-\\ndering. \\n\\nOver  250  business  partners  were  extensively  reviewed  in \\n2021.\\n\\nInternal risk analysis for the prevention of money laundering \\nand terrorism financing\\nUBM Development AG has registered brokerage as one of \\nits commercial activities. The related activities are classified \\ninternationally as having an increased risk of money launder-\\ning, and an internal risk analysis was prepared and is updated \\nregularly to cover the prevention of money laundering and \\nterrorism financing. \\n\\nThe  risk  analysis  for  all  Austrian  subsidiaries  which  have \\nregistered brokerage as one of their commercial activities \\nwas updated through a risk survey in 2021 and filed with the \\nrespective trade authority.

Sustainable procurement &  \\n\\nregional added value  \\n\\nIncreasing regulations in various European countries require \\nthe implementation of corporate due diligence procedures \\nin supply chains and the creation of greater transparency and \\ntraceability with regard to origin, removal and subsequent \\nprocessing. The regulation is addressed to direct upstream \\nsuppliers (general contractors, executing partners) in a first \\nstep, but will be successively rolled out to cover the entire \\nupstream supply chain (raw materials extraction, materials \\nproducers) and the related working conditions and human \\nrights situation.\\n\\nGoals and measures in detail:\\nEnsuring ecological & socio-economic compliance in the \\nvalue chain\\nCompliance  with  social  and  ecological  criteria  in  the  sup-\\nply chain is a key factor for UBM s sustainable procurement. \\nCooperation with local partner companies (e.g. construction \\ncompanies, architects, planners) also has an impact on the \\nlocal economy. Preference should be given to regional sup-\\npliers (among others, due to shorter delivery distances, cost \\nand time savings, protection for local jobs).\\n\\nLast, but not least, COVID-19 and the related restrictions have \\ncreated a greater awareness of the importance of the local \\neconomy. As a major customer for construction companies, \\nplanners and consultants from the region, UBM makes a sig-\\nnificant contribution to local added value, just like the motto \\nsays  Think global, order local . Regional business partners, \\nmeaning companies near the respective locations, play an \\nimportant role in the realisation of projects. That creates jobs \\nand regional added value directly at UBM s project locations.\\n\\nRegional contract awards are definitely a win-win situation. \\nOn the one hand, local companies are supported and, on \\nthe other hand, UBM benefits from shorter delivery routes \\nthat reduce costs and save time, and facilitate the delivery of \\nlarger components. This was demonstrated, among others, \\nby the barany.7 project in Vienna, where an Austrian specialist \\nwas commissioned to erect the building with sustainable and \\nenergy-saving timber construction. UBM created jobs and \\nadded value with this project, directly as well as indirectly.\\n\\nThe code of conduct prepared by UBM in 2020 (see section \\n6.1.) is designed to ensure that suppliers are also aware of \\ntheir responsibility along the supply chain and contribute to \\nthe sustainable development of the real estate sector. This \\ncode is adapted regularly to meet changes in the social and \\nregulatory environment and in fundamental ethic values. The \\nlast update was made in December 2021. A technical solution \\nfor compliance documentation is currently in preparation and \\nwill be implemented in 2022. The documentation of subcon-\\ntractor compliance by existing suppliers will also be reviewed \\nthrough sampling beginning in 2022. In Germany, a subcon-\\ntractor management system will be introduced in 2022.\\n\\nA procurement guideline was prepared in 2021 to strengthen \\necological and social responsibility along the supply chain. \\nIt  defines  standardised  criteria  and  requirements  for  the \\necologically oriented procurement of office and advertising \\nmaterials, catering and hospitality. For example, the selection \\nof an organic fruit supplier for UBM s headquarters in Vienna \\nnow  ensures  deliveries  based  on  seasonal  and  regional \\nfactors.  Daily  meals  for  employees  are  also  supplied  by  a  \\ndelivery service that provides organic foods.\\n\\n101\\n\\nUBM & GOVERNANCE\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##UBM covers all dimensions of sustainability in its develop-\\nment projects, meaning we always consider and respect eco-\\nlogical, economic and socio-cultural aspects. This is under-\\nscored by our goal to arrange for the audit and certification \\nof most of our commercial projects   including residential \\nconstruction in the future   based on recognised sustainability \\nseals like DNGB,  GNI, LEED or BREEAM.\\n\\nThe green. smart. and more. initiative\\nIn line with the above-mentioned management approach, \\nthe green. smart. and more. initiative plays a very special role. \\nIt is backed by a Group-wide brainstorming campaign that \\ncovered several months and the entire workforce in 2020. The \\nfocus was placed on the following seven core issues which \\nwere defined in a dialogue between the Management Board \\nand Executive Committee:\\n\\nThese certifications also involve external experts and auditors \\nto confirm the relevant quality level for building materials. \\nMinimising the environmental impact of a building during its \\nentire lifecycle requires a focus on the efficient use of heating \\nenergy, electricity, water and wastewater during the planning \\nstage.

In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards   Core \\nOption .\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with   267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021.

The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment, because UBM is unable to control the related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe indicators in the section on the environment cover all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and \\nimproved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based \\nprimarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database \\n(v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. \\n\\nWhere  actual  consumption  figures  are  not  available,  esti-\\nmates are used (mainly for project development, where the \\nenergy consumption is calculated as per certificates).\\n\\nDetails are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112.\\nGRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2\\n\\n106\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##7.2.

These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on inde-\\npendence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a \\nlimited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.  \\n\\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract \\n(AAB) 2018, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Tax Advisers and Auditors (https://www.ksw.or.at/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-\\n209/), which also apply towards third parties.

These  forward-looking  statements  can  be  identified  by  words  like   expecta-\\ntion ,   goal   or  similar  terms  and  expressions.

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c',\n",

Our activities\\n\\nUBM  develops  and  sells  real  estate  at  top  locations  with \\nadded  value  potential.  That  is  our  DNA.  With  forward \\nsales, we increase the momentum in our business. Selling \\na  property  before  completion  means  minimising  the  risk \\nand setting a value for the sale which can be included in \\nour  accounting  on  a  proportional  basis  during  the  con-\\nstruction  period.  Real  estate  development  is  our  core \\nexpertise.  This  strategy  guarantees  a  balance  between \\npro tability and risk. UBM s investments are concentrated \\nin markets and asset classes which, based on this balance, \\ngenerate  optimal  added  value  for  our  investors  over  the \\nmedium to long term.\\n\\nUBM acts as a  one-stop shop . We offer all necessary ser-\\nvices from a single source: market analysis, project develop-\\nment, planning and project management,  nancing, rental \\nand  sale.  We  can  rely  on  a  team  of  specialists  with  many \\nyears of professional experience who can accompany pro-\\ncesses from the initial project idea to transfer to the tenant \\nor  nal investor. This know-how makes it possible to cover \\nall stages of the real estate value chain in our own house.\\n\\nUBM s  core  business  is  real  estate  development  with  a \\nfocus on the residential and of ce asset classes. Over 450 \\napartments  were  sold  in  2021.  Based  on  the  Total  Output \\nrecorded  in  the  individual  countries  during  the  past  year, \\nGermany was responsible for 34%, Austria for 42%, Poland \\nfor  17%  and  the  other  markets  for  7%.  The  development \\npipeline  in  UBM s  core  markets  is  also  well- lled  for  the \\nfuture  with   2.2bn  by  2025.  Our  development  projects \\nare clearly focused on the residential segment at 55%. The \\nof ce  segment  covers  45%.  The  German-speaking  coun-\\n\\ntries form the regional focus: We develop more than half of \\nour projects (61%) in Germany and 30% in Austria, followed \\nby  the  Czech  Republic  (7%)  and  other  countries  (2%).  The \\nfocal point of our investments in the future lies, above all, in \\ntop cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Vienna.\\nFor  historical  reasons,  UBM  holds  properties  with  a  total \\nvalue of roughly  300m in its standing investment portfo-\\nlio. These properties represent investments where the com-\\npany cannot decide on a sale without the respective partner, \\nor properties whose sale was not feasible to date for other \\nreasons.

Due to UBM s strate-\\ngic transformation into a  Pure Play Developer , the proper-\\n\\nties are generally sold. The company also holds individual \\nstanding assets in its portfolio  (31% of the total property \\ncarrying amount at year-end 2021), where UBM is responsi-\\nble for asset management. \\nIn line with the commitment to sustainability, the entire life-\\ncycle of a property is evaluated   for example: possibilities \\nfor the later use of a building through refurbishment or the \\nrecyclability of materials in the event of demolition can be \\nactively included in the planning phase.\\n\\nQuality and experience along the value chain \\nAs a  Pure Play Developer , UBM works with a wide variety \\nof  service  providers  and  suppliers.

This  performance \\nwas  supported  by  the  selected  sale  of  projects,  without \\nbeing  involved  in  their  realisation.  The  consequent  focus \\non green. smart. and more. also played an important role. \\nHowever,  successful  strategic  change  not  only  requires  a \\nsolid  nancial basis: UBM has a stronger position than ever \\nbefore with an equity ratio of 37%.\\n\\nThis improvement was based primarily on property sales \\nin  Germany  and  Austria  as  well  as  the  progress  of  con-\\nstruction on previously sold real estate projects which are \\nrecognised over time in accordance with the progress of \\ncompletion and sale.\\n\\nThe  pro t  from  companies  accounted  for  at  equity  rose \\nto  36.0m in 2021 (2020:  27.8m).

Of this \\ntotal,  371.5m represents revenue from property sales. The \\nlargest contributions came from the two core markets, Ger-\\nmany and Austria, where, among others, four projects in the \\npre-development phase were successfully sold. Total Output \\nfor the reporting year was also in uenced, above all, by the \\nprogress of construction on previously sold real estate pro-\\njects which is realised over time in accordance with the per-\\ncentage of completion and realisation. In this category, the \\nlargest contribution to Total Output was made by residen-\\ntial construction projects like the Gmunder H fe in Munich \\nand  the  Siebenbrunnengasse  in  Vienna,  a  project  with  \\n178 apartments designated for individual sale. Other pos-\\nitive  contributions  were  made  by  the  forward  sold  F.A.Z. \\nTower in Frankfurt and two hotels in Poland. \\n\\nEBITDA rose by  10.8m over the previous year to  75.9m \\nin 2021.

The equity \\nratio equalled 37% at year-end 2021 and remained above \\nthe upper end of the 30 35% target range (31 December \\n2020: 35.2%). The issue of a deeply subordinated sustain-\\nability-linked bond (hybrid bond) was  nalised during the \\nsecond  quarter  of  the  reporting  year.

This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans .

It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

       " '2929Two days of pure UBM cultureMore than 200 of our colleagues from Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria took part in our  UBM Day  2021 in Vienna at the end of October. The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead,  50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria s only stationary children s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in dif cult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankesch n\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM s underground car park\\x0c',\n",

       " 'Impact of sustainability issues on UBM\\nA worst-case scenario was developed for each sustainability \\nissue and evaluated by the Management Board together with \\nthe investor relations & ESG department. Gross risks were \\nevaluated on the basis of two dimensions (scope and proba-\\nbility of occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years.\\n\\nRelevance of sustainability issues from the stakeholder \\nperspective\\nInternal and external stakeholders from 12 pre-defined stake-\\nholder groups (see page 44) were invited to take part in an \\nonline survey where they were asked to rank the individual \\nissues according to their priority and to select the five most \\nimportant issues. The survey was sent to 700 stakeholders \\nand generated 208 evaluable results (representing a return \\nrate of 33 %).\\n\\nThe three perspectives formed the framework for the assess-\\nment and prioritisation of the issues based on their impor-\\ntance for UBM and its stakeholders as well as the impact on \\nthe environment and society. In a workshop with the Manage-\\nment Board and the internal experts responsible for the areas \\nof environment, society and governance, the findings were \\ndiscussed and three material issues were identified:\\n\\n  Energy efficiency, renewable energies and  \\n\\nCO2 emissions\\n\\n  Attractive employer & training and education\\n  Corporate governance and compliance\\n\\n3.4. Materiality analysis\\n\\nTo meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups. \\n\\nThe major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year. \\n\\nThe first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:\\n\\n  UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n  The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n  The relevance of sustainability issues from the  \\n\\nstakeholder perspective\\n\\nUBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.  \\n\\n46\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c',\n",

One related step was the announcement in \\n2021 of UBM s commitment as an official supporter of the \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\nThe TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate- \\nrelated risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk \\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\\n\\nThe  TCFD  recommendations  on  the  reporting  of  climate- \\nrelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and grad-\\nually implemented. Additional information on the risk man-\\nagement system can be found in the annual report beginning \\non page 119.\\n\\nGovernance\\nThe  overall  responsibility  for  general  risk  management  at \\nUBM lies with the Management Board. The head of risk man-\\nagement is responsible for the operational risk management \\nprocess. A risk catalogue with the most significant individual \\nrisks was developed jointly at a meeting of the Management \\nBoard, risk manager and risk coordinators. ESG risks in con-\\nnection with sustainability issues were evaluated extensively \\nas  part  of  the  materiality  analysis  in  2021  and  2020  (see \\nsection  3.4.). The  full  Management  Board  was  involved  in \\nthis risk analysis together with the investor relations & ESG \\ndepartment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of \\nCO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM s long-term suc-\\ncess  and,  consequently,  an  elementary  part  of  the  green. \\nsmart. and more. corporate strategy. Given the substantial \\nshare of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, increasing \\nregulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and \\nreal estate sector are to be expected. The revised EU Energy \\nPerformance of Buildings Directive took effect on 1 January \\n2021  and  deals  with  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings.  It \\nrequires all new buildings to be built as nearly zero-energy \\nbuildings (according to the respective national definition). \\nBuildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk \\nbeing denied a building permit in the future. Climate protec-\\ntion, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. \\nthrough regulations covering primary energy requirements). \\nThat could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a \\ndecline in investor demand for investments that are not clas-\\nsified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also \\nincreasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for \\nbuilding operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 \\npricing scheme which, for example, is planned to be intro-\\nduced in Austria in 2022, will create financial disadvantages \\nfor  fossil  energy  carriers.  UBM  has  shifted  its  focus  to  the \\ncarbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies \\nlike geothermal power or photovoltaics, and green building \\ncertification as part of its green. strategy. Intelligent buildings \\nand solutions for efficient building operations are anchored \\nin this strategy with smart.\\n\\n56\\n\\nUBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c',\n",

One of the greatest challenges for real estate \\ndevelopers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of \\ntheir activities on the environment. Economic success and \\nsustainable project development represent an area of ten-\\nsion but go hand in hand at UBM: Sustainable management \\nis the basis for economic success   and economic success is \\nthe basis for sustainable management.

Specific measures are described in \\ngreater detail in section 4.  \\n\\nRisk management\\nIn the course of general risk management, the probability \\nof occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the \\nabove-mentioned risks are evaluated twice each year by the \\nManagement Board. The risk system is audited annually and \\nadapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances. \\nExamples of ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are \\nhuman resource risks (e.g. internal fraud, health, employee \\nturnover) and the operating risks associated with buildings \\n(e.g.  force  majeure).  The  risks  arising  from  daily  business \\noperations are identified, assessed and controlled through \\nappropriate measures by operating management. The com-\\npliance function monitors adherence to external and internal \\nrules and regulations, while internal audit ensures independ-\\nent and objective monitoring. \\n\\nThe evaluation of gross risks as part of the ESG risk analysis \\nin 2021 was based on two dimensions (scope and probability \\nof occurrence) over a time horizon of roughly ten years. The \\nmost important risks were identified with this evaluation and \\nsubsequently flowed into UBM s materiality analysis as one \\nof the three dimensions.\\n\\nMetrics and targets\\nUBM has defined measures and indicators for assessment \\nand management along the three fields of environment, soci-\\nety and governance.

This \\nis due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal \\ninsulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived \\nas comfortable.

Water and wastewater utilisation and  \\n\\nwaste in building operations \\n\\nExamples of the measures taken in the standing assets and \\nGroup locations are provided below:\\n\\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and \\nfacility management have developed a waste concept. We \\nalso ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna \\nbased on an established concept. A digital solution for waste \\nmanagement similar to the one used in Berlin is also in prepa-\\nration. \\n\\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in \\n2020. That led to a significant reduction in paper consumption \\nand also complements the previously established controlling \\nsystems.\\n\\nOn UBM Day, which was certified as a  green meeting  in line \\nwith the Austrian Ecolabel criteria, specific measures were \\nalso implemented to minimise waste. Disposable tableware \\nwas not used, the decorations were rented or designed for \\nmultiple use, beverages were served from bulk packs, and all \\nwaste was correctly separated.   GRI 2-23, 2-25\\n\\nIn the operation of buildings, water and wastewater utilisa-\\ntion play an important role. The recycling of rainwater and \\ngrey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings \\nin kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of \\nfresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sus-\\ntainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through \\nrequirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection \\nmanagement plans). \\n\\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water \\nexceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where \\nthe usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor qual-\\nity. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of \\nfresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, \\ndehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, \\netc.) reasons. Due to its geographical focus, UBM is relatively \\nunaffected by water stress at the present time. \\n\\nAlthough consumption is primarily influenced by end users, \\nwe still implement effective measures. One example is the \\nMercure Katowice Centrum: Its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 \\ngreen facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol \\nof the  green and clean  motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in \\npockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on \\ntextile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater \\ncollected in the basement. \\n\\nWaste management is also important in building operations. \\nThe  avoidance  of  waste  saves  energy  and  resources,  and \\nthe organised collection of waste allows for correct material \\nrecycling. End users, in particular, can also influence waste \\ngeneration and separation. \\n\\n79\\n\\nUBM & ENVIRONMENT\\x0c',\n",

The office will become a place where coexist-\\nence is lived and new ideas are born. \\n\\nThe study  The State of Skills 2021  shows that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has intensified the need to acquire new skills but \\nalso reduced development opportunities. Limited possibil-\\nities to invest in learning and development, combined with \\nrising demands on new skills and competences can cause \\nproblems at several levels over the long term.

This area is under \\ndevelopment based on specifications set by the city s devel-\\nopment commission and the integration of citizens  concerns. \\nUp-to-date  information  on  the  progress  of  construction  is \\npublished on a project website, and an ombudsman service \\nis available to deal with wishes, suggestions or complaints. \\n\\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  representatives  of  public \\nauthorities,  decisions  are  coordinated  on  relevant  issues \\ninvolving the functional mix of the quarter as well as aspects \\nlike working place comfort, accessibility and the best possible \\nreduction of emissions and immissions.\\n\\nThe  instruments  to  reach  these  goals  are  diverse.  Green \\nareas, climate resilience, facade greening, the use of ground \\nstorage mass, networking between the buildings, real-time \\ndata on operating parameters to optimise energy consump-\\ntion and much, much more are planned for the LeopoldQuar-\\ntier and will create exemplary added value. In particular, the \\ngreen zone   an expanded green area in the inner courtyard \\n  is of great importance for the area and will contribute to the \\nquality of life for all users and neighbouring residents. Special \\nattention is also given to land re-naturalisation, the preserva-\\ntion of seepage capability, the creation of optimal living con-\\nditions for fauna and flora as well as rooftops with semi-inten-\\nsive biodiverse planting. Photovoltaic elements will also be \\ninstalled on these roofs to create a balance between energy \\nproduction and climate improvement. The LeopoldQuartier \\nwill generate energy on site with wells and depth probes. \\nHeating and cooling supplies for all buildings in the quarter \\nwill be produced centrally and CO2-neutral.\\n\\nLocal supplies, social networking and mobility offerings are \\nthe  basic  components  of  this  urban  quarter  development \\nproject. In addition to shared spaces, shared mobility and \\nshared activities, the use of a quarter management app is \\nalso  under  evaluation  to  make  the  offerings  and  services \\navailable to users and neighbours. All these measures will \\nhelp to create smart and green living space that sustainably \\nincreases and improves the value of the area surrounding \\nthe LeopoldQuartier.\\n\\nThe LeopoldQuartier represents a milestone for UBM in the \\nimplementation of its green. smart. and more. strategy for \\nsustainable  urban  quarter  development.

Importance of the issue  \\nCompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  voluntary \\nstandards is an important part of responsible management. \\nThe construction and management of properties produces \\nsocial benefits and can help to improve the quality of life, \\nbut also consumes natural resources and releases hazardous \\nsubstances into the environment which, in turn, increases the \\npressure on (local) public authorities. \\n\\nThe relevance of compliance and compliance management \\nsystems has increased significantly in recent years for many \\ndifferent reasons. On the one hand, due to numerous new \\nlegal requirements that are connected with criminal penalties \\nand, on the other hand, criminal prosecution is becoming \\nmore and more consequent. \\n\\nViolations of legal requirements not only represent a signifi-\\ncant risk for companies but are also connected with personal \\nconsequences for individuals. Companies can face fines, pen-\\nalties and civil claims by damaged parties. In many cases, \\nthat can lead to exclusion from public tenders and harm the \\ncompany s reputation.\\n\\nKey aspects of real estate development include, above all, \\ncorrect  tenders  (e.g.  for  construction  services),  the  fight \\nagainst corruption and bribery, proper working conditions \\nand taxation behaviour by subcontractors as well as trans-\\nparent internal guidelines and conduct rules. \\n\\nThe  issue  of  human  rights  along  the  entire  value  chain \\ndeserves  special  attention  and  has  gained  momentum  in \\nrecent years   also in the EU: In addition to various sustainable \\nfinance regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Directive (CSRD), discussions centre on inten-\\nsifying due diligence requirements in the supply chain and \\nstrengthening sustainability requirements for the Supervisory \\nBoard ( Sustainable Corporate Governance ) to include man-\\ndatory human rights and environmental due diligence.\\n\\nCompanies  that  fail  to  meet  environmental  standards  or \\nethical norms will be increasingly penalised by the financial \\nmarkets, with a resulting negative effect on share prices and \\nfinancial stability.

The \\nprevention of emissions, use of resource-efficient building \\nmaterials, increase in energy efficiency and the greater inte-\\ngration of technological solutions are only a few of the key-\\nwords.

       " 'Digitalisation of the UBM working world \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of the \\ncentral role played by digitalisation in keeping the economy, \\neducational  system  and  society  running  smoothly  during \\nthe lockdowns. UBM has made massive investments in the \\nGroup s digitalisation in recent years and plans to continue \\nthese efforts in the future.\\n\\nUBM launched the  Next Level  project in 2017 to digitally \\nmap operating and work processes as well as reporting and \\ncontrolling at corporate level. The  newBM  project started in \\n2020 and is intended to move digitalisation at UBM a great \\nqualitative leap forward, especially in the commercial areas \\nbut also in IT and infrastructure.\\n\\nThe  newBM  project included the development of an SAP \\nS/4 HANA system based on standard processes and SAP best \\npractices for 250 companies. A modern system supports the \\nfull digital management of HR processes, and a central treas-\\nury  system  safeguards  the  encrypted,  safe  and  integrated \\nhandling of payment flows throughout the Group. The IT con-\\nversion also includes the latest IT equipment and is focused \\non productivity, security and flexible working.   GRI 2-23, 2-25 \\n\\nMoreover:\\n\\n  The certification of two listed revitalisation projects  \\n\\ncontinued in 2021 and will be completed shortly\\n  Certification has focused since 2021 not only on  \\n\\ncommercial projects but also on all new residential  \\nconstruction projects scheduled for global sales\\n\\n  Quarter certification is targeted   with the  \\n\\nLeopoldQuartier as a flagship project \\n\\nThe  core  issues  of  User  Services,  Technology  &  Data  and \\nMobility are designed to make UBM s real estate develop-\\nment   intelligent   through  the  use  of  technological  solu-\\ntions and, as a result, improve and individualise the user ex- \\nperience. As early as the planning stage, UBM ensures that \\nbuildings are equipped for future  smartness  trends   like \\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) or sensors   and can be adapted \\naccordingly.\\n\\nFuture-oriented mobility concepts will also play a role in quar-\\nter development projects through the interaction of e-mo-\\nbility, shared services and intelligent parking concepts. The \\nneeds of users and the local environment can therefore be \\nmet with the highest possible level of efficiency and resource \\nprotection.\\n\\nIn order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM cre-\\nated the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022. \\nThis non-profit foundation provides a platform for partners \\nfrom industry and science to develop technical application \\nsolutions  for  smart  buildings.

It provides information on the 2021 financial year of \\nUBM Development AG.\\n\\nUBM published its first sustainability report in 2017, which \\nwas based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI). In 2018 and 2019, sustainability issues were handled \\nin a more compact non-financial statement that was part of \\nfinancial reporting and the annual report. The report for 2020 \\nwas  prepared  in  agreement  with  the  GRI  standards   Core \\nOption .\\n\\nThis report on the 2021 financial year was prepared in accord-\\nance with   267a UGB and the GRI Standards 2021. The finan-\\ncial year of UBM Development AG is based on the calendar \\nyear and covers the period from 1 January to 31 December. \\nThe next report is planned for 2023 and will include informa-\\ntion on the 2022 financial year. \\n\\nThe report contents reflect the major thematic areas relevant \\nfor UBM. These areas changed in comparison with 2020 fol-\\nlowing a new materiality analysis (see section 3) and adjust-\\nments to reflect the GRI standards for 2021. The new pres-\\nentation of information from previous reports is documented \\nin the footnotes beginning on page 112. The reported indi-\\ncators, where available, also cover 2020 and 2019.\\n\\nThe management of UBM Development AG is responsible \\nfor preparation of the report content. An external review with \\nlimited assurance was carried out by PwC (see page 125). \\n\\nIf you have any questions or suggestions on this report, please \\nfeel  free  to  contact  UBM  at  esg@ubm-development.com.  \\nCurrent information on sustainability can also be found on \\nour website under the menu item  ESG . \\n\\nGender-neutral language was used in the report, where pos-\\nsible, to improve readability and the flow of the text, and no \\ndistinction was made between the genders. In the sense of \\n\\nequal opportunities, corresponding terms generally apply to \\nall genders.\\n\\nScope of consolidation  \\nThis report covers the corporate locations, standing assets \\nand development projects of UBM Development in Austria, \\nGermany, Poland, the Czech Republic and other markets. \\n\\nIn  the  hotel  business,  which  was  a  focal  point  of  activities \\nbefore the strategic reorientation, UBM took over the role \\nof  the  lessee  in  selected  cases  following  the  sale  of  the \\nrespective properties. The hotel leasing business was bun-\\ndled under UBM hotels Management GmbH in 2016, and \\nUBM holds an interest of 50% in this company today. Large, \\ninternational hotel chains have been engaged for the oper-\\national management of these houses, whereby preference is \\ngiven to partners who are aware of their ecological and social \\nresponsibility and have appropriate certification. This report \\ndoes not deal with environmental issues related to the hotel \\noperating company, which represents an equity-accounted \\ninvestment, because UBM is unable to control the related \\nmeasures and guidelines.   \\n\\nThe indicators in the section on the environment cover all \\ncompanies with a Group investment of more than 50%, all \\nGroup locations with more than 5% of the total workforce, and \\nprojects which had received building permits by 31 Decem-\\nber 2021. ESG reporting will be continuously advanced and \\nimproved. The calculation of emissions for 2021 were based \\nprimarily on the CO2e factors from the Sphera GaBi database \\n(v14) to achieve consistency and actuality. \\n\\nWhere  actual  consumption  figures  are  not  available,  esti-\\nmates are used (mainly for project development, where the \\nenergy consumption is calculated as per certificates).\\n\\nDetails are provided in the footnotes starting on page 112.\\nGRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14, 3-2\\n\\n106\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\\x0c',\n",

These  forward-looking  statements  can  be  identified  by  words  like   expecta-\\ntion ,   goal   or  similar  terms  and  expressions.  Forward-looking  statements,  by  definition,  include  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  forecasts  con-\\ncerning  the  future  development  of  the  company  represent  estimates  which  are  based  on  the  information  available  at  the  time  the  annual \\nreport  was  prepared.  If  the  assumptions  underlying  these  forecasts  do  not  materialise  or  if  unexpected  risks  occur  at  an  amount  not  quan-\\ntified  or  quantifiable,  the  actual  future  development  and  actual  future  results  can  differ  from  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  forecasts. \\n \\nSignificant  factors  for  these  types  of  deviations  can  include,  for  example,  changes  in  the  general  economic  environment  or  the  legal  and  reg-\\nulatory  framework  in Austria  and  the  EU  as  well  as  changes  in  the  real  estate  sector.  UBM  Development AG  will  not  guarantee  or  assume  any \\nliability  for  the  agreement  of  future  development  and  future  results  with  the  estimates  and  assumptions  made  in  this  ESG  report.  UBM \\nDevelopment  AG  will  not  update  these  forward-looking  statements  to  reflect  actual  events  or  changes  in  assumptions  and  expectations. \\n \\nThe ESG report as of 31 December 2021 was prepared with the greatest possible care to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information in all sec-\\ntions. The amounts were rounded based on the compensated summation method. However, rounding, typesetting and printing errors cannot be excluded. \\n \\nThis ESG report is published in English and German and is available in both languages on the website of UBM Development AG. In the event of a \\ndiscrepancy or deviation, the German language version takes precedence.\\n\\nThis ESG report was printed on Olin regular absolute white, an FSC-certified paper that meets the highest demands for environmental compatibility.\\n\\n202122019\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c ', '  5 \\x0c ', '  U B M   A T   A   G L A N C E Our strategy can be  \\nsummarised in four words:  \\ngreen. smart. and more.

As a company listed in Austria with subsidiaries in Cen-tral Europe, UBM Development is active on the interna-tional capital market. UBM shares are listed in Vienna s Prime Market, the segment with the highest transparency standards. We therefore view the requirements of the EU Taxonomy as central for our operations. The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments  ts per-fectly with UBM s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our  nancing to green  nancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans . Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate  nancing. Over the longer term, we also see  green bonds  as attrac-tive tools for green  nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speci c use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien f r Europas Metropolen.

Sustainability  not only demands an ecological approach  but also socially farsighted thinking. We are working, step by step, to build  a UBM that also leads the way with  high social competence. As an employer,  we support cooperation and fairness.  As a developer, we create innovative  building concepts for generations to come.  And as a good corporate citizen, we live  our responsibility to society.UBM IN DETAIL27\\x0c ', '  2828The DIY developerSocial aspects are just as important for green thinking. As UBM, we also want to offer a real community. That begins in our of ces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

Lectures and presentations on climate protec-tion, such as by ORF weatherman Marcus Wadsak, lives-treams and a team quiz sharpened awareness of one of the greatest challenges of our time. We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM s underground car park. In view of the great interest and vig-orous support, we have decided to hold a Climate Impact 50,000 euros for the SterntalerhofUBM continued its long-standing tradition and waived gifts for business partners and employees at Christmas 2021. Instead,  50,000 was donated to the Sterntalerhof in Loipersdorf (Burgenland). This facility houses Austria s only stationary children s hospice for families with severely, chronically or terminally ill children. With our donation, we want to help the Sterntalerhof continue its valuable work and give new strength to families in dif cult situations.UBM IN DETAIL  Sterntalerhof Donation for the children s hospiceClimate Impact Day Ein Fahrradservice  als Dankesch n\"UBM-Express\" at the Business RunClimate Impact Day Speaker Marcus Wadsak Climate Impact Day Bicycle maintenance  in UBM s underground car park\\x0c ', '  3131UBM IN DETAILDay in the other UBM countries as a  xed part of our schedule starting in 2022.  smart  and  green travelling  as education In October 2021, roughly 30 of our colleagues travelled to Berlin to learn about the realisation of smart of ce building ideas on site and, above all, to also experience the UBM community outside the of ce. A number of colleagues involved with UBM s  green  strategy took a trip to the Austrian province of Vorarl-berg at the same time, where they reviewed model pro-jects and workshops for timber construction. The participants in both trips gained new impressions and valuable impulses for their future work and for cooperation throughout the UBM Group.

Materiality analysis To meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups.  The major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year.  The first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:   UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n  The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n  The relevance of sustainability issues from the   stakeholder perspective UBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.   46 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c ', '     Water consumption  and  waste  were combined  under  water & wastewater utilisation, waste in building \\noperations .

The former issue  cooperations  is still an integral part  of UBM s activities but is not reported as a separate \\nentity.   \\nGRI 2-12, 2-29, 3-1, 3-2 The results were recorded in a materiality matrix and, in line \\nwith the ESG structure, classified under the areas of environ-\\nment,  society  and  governance  for  sustainability  reporting. \\nHere, employees and society are covered under the same \\nheading. The matrix shows all three dimensions and is ori-\\nented on the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft as \\nwell as the GRI standards 2021. The three material issues for \\nUBM are described in detail in the following sections, and the \\nother issues are also explained.  There  were  a  number  of  changes  in  comparison  with  the \\nmateriality analysis from 2020:    Energy consumption  and  GHG (greenhouse gases)   were combined under the material issue  energy  \\nefficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions . \\n   Fair working conditions  and  employee training  \\nand education  were assigned to the material issue \\n attractive employer & training and education . \\n   Ethics & compliance  was renamed  corporate   governance and compliance  and identified as a  \\nmaterial issue.

Digitalisation and technology  was expanded to  include innovation ( innovation and technologies ). \\n   Adaptation to climate change  and  biodiversity    were combined into a single issue ( ground sealing, \\nadaptation to climate change and biodiversity ).

WinklerCEO, ChairmanPatric ThateCFOMartina Maly-G rtnerCOODear Shareholders,Dear Stakeholders,The westernmost city in Ukraine, Uzhhorod, is closer to Vienna than Bregenz in the far west of Austria. In view of this war on our doorstep, it appears to be reasonable to ask the one or other question on the current signi cance of ESG. But really? As part of our social responsibility, we made 150 rooms in our Polish hotels available as immediate assistance for the  rst refugees from Ukraine. That is also ESG   it stands for the  S  in Environment, Social and Governance.Naturally, this war has also increased the focus on energy supplies in Europe and the dependence on Russian gas, especially in Germany and Austria, our two core markets. Gas, regardless of where it originates, is neither environmentally friendly nor sustainable as a primary energy source and is responsible for three quarters of the CO2 emissions from buildings during their operation. That means nearly 10 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. In other words: The war in Ukraine has not changed    just underscored   the importance of ESG. ESG is an integral part of UBM s green. smart. and more. strategy. That is also re ected in the focus on green building, green  nancing and green thinking which is documented in our annual report through in-depth and interesting articles. With timber construction, we are using the greatest lever available to us as a real estate developer to prevent CO2 emissions. Bonds with coupons that are linked to our ESG rating also con rm our commitment to ESG. And green thinking governs all our entrepreneurial actions. Our ESG report will be audited for the  rst time by an independent chartered accountant, despite the fact that we are not even required to prepare a report. Moreover, the ESG Committee at the Supervisory Board level demonstrates the signi cance of ESG for UBM   also and especially in times like these.We would like to thank you for your interest in this key issue and hope we have been able to meet your information needs with this report.2-22\\x0c ',\n",

The criteria cata-logue for ecological sustainability of investments  ts per-fectly with UBM s strategy for successful, long-term devel-opment activities.2021 signalled the start of our programme to convert our  nancing to green  nancing. This took place, above all, through the issue of two sustainability-linked bonds based on an ambitious rating.Excellent and convincing ESG ratings The well-known rating agency EcoVadis placed UBM among the top two per cent of the real estate and con-struction sector and in the top  ve per cent of over 75,000 ranked companies. We also received a gold award from EcoVadis. In the internationally recognised ISS ESG rating, we are listed as one of the three best companies in our sector in Austria and Germany. And ISS ESG also raised UBM to Prime Status. The costs of our bond  nancing are now linked directly to our ESG rating.Sustainably successful on the capital marketIn May 2021, we became the  rst company in Austria to issue a senior ESG-linked bond on the Vienna Stock Exchange. This UBM bond has a volume of 150 million euros and a coupon of 3.125 per cent with redemption at maturity. The sustainability focus includes our commitment, as the issuer, to reach a high ESG rating. Failure to meet this goal will increase the repay-ment amount by ten basis points per year.In June, we placed another hybrid bond with a volume of 100 million euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Its unlimited term is linked to an interest step-up mechanism that calls for an increase of 500 basis points after  ve years if UBM does not redeem the bond. The bond carries a coupon of 5.5 per cent. Similar to the senior bond, the sustainability focus includes UBM s commitment to reach a speci c ESG rating threshold or the repayment amount will increase by 15 basis points per year.These two bonds converted a total of 250 million euros to green  nancing in a very short time. Considering the total bond volume of nearly 700 million euros, that represents a rad-ical reorientation. green  nancing is also project-based The conversion of our credit  nancing represents the next step to even more green  nancing because an increasing number of our development projects qualify for  green loans . Sustain-ability-linked bonds support our general corporate  nancing. Over the longer term, we also see  green bonds  as attrac-tive tools for green  nancing. However, these bonds are ear-marked for a speci c use and UBM must prove that nearly 100 per cent of the funds are used exclusively for the respective green project.www.ubm-development.comgreen. smart. and more.UBM DevelopmentUBM Development entwickelt  Immobilien f r Europas Metropolen.

That begins in our of ces and ends with our social activities.green thinking is an attitude which we also see as a sustain- able, corporate-wide learning process. It covers UBM s training and educational programmes as well as our  UBM Day , which is held every two years and has since grown to cover nearly two days.The construction and operation of buildings is responsible for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions. That s more than all traf c combined, including automobiles, or any other major industrial sector. As an international devel-oper of properties and entire urban quarters, UBM is also challenged to address the ecological aspect of sustain- ability. Worldwide, building construction is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of CO2 each year. The production of concrete and steel for building  materials causes over two billion tonnes of this total. The increasing replacement of both, as practised by UBM, shows that an enormous gain is possible. In our development projects, we have also started to include modern, renewable forms of primary energy sup-plies like geothermal power combined with solar energy. Ef cient thermal insulation, sophisticated building tech-nology and the smart management of systems like air con-ditioning, lighting and ventilation help to save additional energy. green thinking.Always going all out.

The mixture of interactive team assignments, interesting lec-tures and exciting events as well as donation vouchers for charitable contributions in place of mementos were very well received. By the end of the day, all of the participants were able to feel the UBM strategy and experience the Group-wide community  live . In these times of COVID-19, it was a particularly valuable happening. We organised the UBM Day for the  rst time as a  green meeting  in line with the Austrian Ecolabel criteria. That meant compliance with a long list of requirements   from environmentally friendly travel to the prohibition of plastic badges and the use of eggs from free-range hens by the catering  rm.Social days for good purposes UBM gives employees interested in demonstrating their social commitment an extra day off each year. Several of our colleagues spent their social day in 2021 at the  Caritas am Himmel  during the summer. In this special day retreat on the Cobenzl, an idyllic hill on the outskirts of Vienna, they helped a number of clients put the overgrown garden into shape. And while they were there, they also built a long-awaited shady rest area. A trip to the  Lichtblickhof  brings light into the daily routine of many children and young people who suffer from grief, trauma, physical impairment or illness. This facility at Vien-na s Otto Wagner Hospital has successfully used equother-apy with horses for many years. In the weeks before Christ-mas 2021, a number of UBM employees set out to support the therapy centre. They helped to assemble and put up the festive Christmas decorations   and for an entire day, lent a hand wherever practical support was welcome.

We also underscored the importance of every seemingly unimportant initiative with a small gesture: The employees who cycled to work received a free bicycle maintenance check-up in UBM s underground car park.

Materiality analysis To meet our responsibility towards society and the environ-\\nment, we rely on a structured process to monitor and evaluate \\nsocial and ecological developments. This process is based \\non the concept of  double materiality , meaning an evalua-\\ntion from the outside-in (risks from the company s viewpoint, \\nimpact on our business and added value) and inside-out per-\\nspective (UBM s impact on people and the environment). A \\nthird dimension is the perspective of significant stakeholder \\ngroups.  The major issues for UBM were redefined in 2021 as part \\nof a materiality analysis based on these three dimensions. \\nThis revision was required to accommodate changes in inter-\\nnational regulations and standards, in particular the EFRAG  \\nrecommendation  to  the  CSRD  draft  (2021)  and  the  GRI \\nupdate 2021. The resulting materiality matrix forms the basis \\nfor this ESG report and replaces the version used last year.  The first step involved compiling a list of 17 potential material \\nissues based on a comprehensive contact analysis, studies on \\nmegatrends, an extensive peer group review and discussions \\nwith internal experts. The evaluation of the importance and \\nimpact of these issues followed three perspectives:   UBM s impact on people, society and the environment \\n  The impact of sustainability issues on UBM \\n  The relevance of sustainability issues from the   stakeholder perspective UBM s impact on people, society and the environment\\nBased on the valuation approach in the CSRD draft (2021), \\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the  impact \\non  people,  society  and  the  environment  were  carried  out \\ntogether with external experts. The ecological assessments \\nare based on simplified carbon footprint measurements and \\nother indicators that support an expert-based evaluation of \\nthe ecological impact. The social assessments are based on \\nan estimate of the number of involved persons (range), the \\nimpact on their quality of life (scope) and the irreversibility \\nof the impact.   46 UBM & SUSTAINABILITY\\x0c ',\n",

The matrix shows all three dimensions and is ori-\\nented on the EFRAG recommendation to the CSRD draft as \\nwell as the GRI standards 2021. The three material issues for \\nUBM are described in detail in the following sections, and the \\nother issues are also explained.  There  were  a  number  of  changes  in  comparison  with  the \\nmateriality analysis from 2020:    Energy consumption  and  GHG (greenhouse gases)   were combined under the material issue  energy  \\nefficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions . \\n   Fair working conditions  and  employee training  \\nand education  were assigned to the material issue \\n attractive employer & training and education . \\n   Ethics & compliance  was renamed  corporate   governance and compliance  and identified as a  \\nmaterial issue.     Users  well-being  and  incentives for environmentally  friendly behaviour  were split off into  customer  \\norientation and creating awareness  and  healthy  \\nbuilding materials and quality of life .     Digitalisation and technology  was expanded to  include innovation ( innovation and technologies ). \\n   Adaptation to climate change  and  biodiversity    were combined into a single issue ( ground sealing, \\nadaptation to climate change and biodiversity ).

The direct consequences of construction \\nactivity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats \\nand an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated \\nareas as well as a decline in the regeneration of groundwater \\ndue to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk \\nof highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes \\nthe microclimate   local temperatures increase and new heat \\nrecords are set (heat islands)   and can cause serious health \\nproblems for the people involved.   Use cradle-to-cradle approach to dismantling   for all new development projects  The planning stage for all UBM projects must include and \\nevaluate  the  use  of  sustainable  and/or  recycled  building \\nmaterials.
