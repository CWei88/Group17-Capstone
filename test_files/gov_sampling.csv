"In view of the results of the study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee in January/February 2022 (detailed below) and the recent departure of a member of the Executive Board to manage another company in the industry, the Nomination and Compensation Committee felt it was appropriate to recommend to the Supervisory Board that it establish the components of compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board that would represent the compensation policy applicable for fiscal year 2022, taking into account certain changes in relation to the policy applicable for fiscal year 2021 which were approved by the Supervisory Board: Maintain the current compensation structure based on three components: Fixed compensation, determined on the basis of the responsibilities of the Chairman and of the other members of the Executive Board, which must be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain the best talent, Short-term variable compensation, the aim of which is to associate the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board with the Groups short-term performance, and Long-term incentives, to align the interests of the beneficiaries as closely as possible with the interests of shareholders, with a view to creating long-term value; Maintain (practically unchanged) the maximum total compensation for the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board.",re
"Positioning of Executive Board member compensation in light of reference panels To ensure a consistent approach, the benchmark study conducted by the Nomination and Compensation Committee to verify the market positioning of the compensation of the Executive Board members was based on the same two panels as those used during the previous changes in the compensation policy that took place in 2019: a panel of 40 SBF 120 companies centered around Klpierres last The charts below show that the 2022 compensation levels for executive corporate officers as submitted to the vote of the General Meeting are consistent with Klpierres positioning (in terms of its market capitalization) within the reference panels selected.",re

"Should a new Chairman of the Executive Board be appointed, the principles and criteria provided for in the last compensation policy approved by the General Meeting would also apply to that person.",re
"In such cases, acting on the recommendation of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the Supervisory Board will, in light of existing practices and based on the situation of the executive concerned, determine the different components of compensation, which shall a) Fixed annual compensation for fiscal year 2022 not exceed those set out in said policy.",re
"To summarize, Jean-Marc Jestins compensation is typically split into equal portions between the fixed component (including benefits in kind), the short-term variable component and the long-term variable component.",re
"The Chairman of the Executive Boards compensation includes the following components: The fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Executive Board for fiscal year 2022 is set at: 750,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of his termination or re-appointment in 2022; and 825,000 payable on a pro rata basis for the period between the date of his re-appointment in 2022 and December 31, 2022.",re
Achieving the target net current cash flow per share announced by Klpierre as guidance to the market grants entitlement to 60% of the fixed annual compensation.,re
"In addition, a performance floor has been set at 95% of the target.",re
Qualitative component Weighting Capped at 50% of fixed annual compensation.,re
"Description The qualitative portion of variable compensation is measured by applying several criteria and for 2022 is based around the following topics: Promotion of CSR; Strategy implemented to enhance the quality of the portfolio (developments, investments, disposals); Risk management; Management of human capital.",re
"These specific targets are decided by the Supervisory Board for the year concerned according to the priorities set by the Board, acting on the recommendation of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, and are communicated to the Chairman of the Executive Board.",re
The overall short-term variable compensation paid to the Chairman of the Executive Board is capped at 150% of his fixed annual compensation as stated in the 2022 compensation policy.,re
"The Supervisory Board may, in exceptional circumstances and having solicited the opinion of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, use its judgment to adapt and/or amend the criteria and/or calculation scale (upwards or downwards) used to determine the annual short-term variable compensation of the Chairman and the other members of the Executive Board, in the event that the impact of such an exceptional circumstance were disproportionate with regard to the fundamental principles of the compensation policy.",re
"These performance conditions are based on financial, non-financial and operating targets that contribute to the goals of the compensation policy: Conditions that encourage the achievement of the Groups operating and financial targets and thus drive greater value creation for shareholders.",re

"The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) has provided input to the development of the sustainable development and energy transition metrics.",og
"In making salary determinations, the REMCO will consider: the market positioning of the compensation packages; comparison with Senior Management salaries; the employee context, and planned average salary increase for other employees across the Netherlands, the UK and the USA; the experience, skills and performance of the Executive Director, or any change in the scope and responsibility of their role; general economic conditions, Shells financial performance, and governance trends; the impact of salary increases on pension benefits and other elements of the and package.",og

The REMCO will use its judgement to determine the appropriate level of compensation by matching the value of any lost awards under variable remuneration arrangements with the candidates previous employer.,og
This compensation may take the form of a one-off cash payment or an additional award under the LTIP.,og

"The statutory compensation is capped at one times the annual salary, which is deemed to include variable pay such as the annual bonus.",og
Executive Directors are expected not to claim transition compensation or any other applicable statutory compensation over and above the agreed compensation for lossof office as set out in the End of employment table on page 196.,og
"In cases of resignation or dismissal for cause, fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits, and employer pension contributions) will cease on the lastday of employment, variable remuneration elements will generally lapse and the Executive Director is not eligible for compensation for lossofoffice.",og
