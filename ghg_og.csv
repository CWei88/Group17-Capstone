"TheGlobal Process Owner is responsible for working across Shellbusinesses to ensure the GHG and energy management requirements are adopted and embedded in business operations, planning, and performance management processes."
Our GHG & Energy Management process is integrated into our annual business planning cycle.
"We continue to engage with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and we are a member of its Technical Working Group that is currently working to define its methodology to set science-based targets for the oil,gas and integrated energy sector."
Our performance standards are used for measuring a projects averagelifetime GHG-intensity or energy efficiency per asset type.
"The respective projects GHG abatement plan helps to determine the nature of these targets, and we assess the effects ofa projects emissions alongside economic and technical design factors."
We estimate the future GHG emissions of projects in two ways.
"During these updates, the Executive Committee and Board consider the significance of the climate change and GHG emissions risks relative to other risks on the Group risk profile and review whether our risk responses are effective in addressing the four sub-components of the climate change and GHG emissions risk."
"For example, in relation to our climate ambitions, SIAI conducted four GHG audits during 2021 to test whether controls are adequately designed and operating effectively to mitigate the identified risks."
"Thecontrols tested covered GHG emissions measurement and reporting, abatement projects and GHG forecasts."
"Project-level risk management in action During project development stages, we consider ways to reduce GHG emissions and whether to include them in the design."
